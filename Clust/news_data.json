- The longest government shutdown in history just reached the throwing-the-toys-out-of-the-stroller stage.","President Donald Trump, in a fit of pique after his State of the Union address was put on ice, grounded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday hours before she was to jet off to Afghanistan on a government aircraft.","The escalating cycle of one-upmanship risked leaving America's two most powerful political leaders looking juvenile and oblivious as 800,000 government workers lament empty wallets and airports set up food banks for security staff.","Yet the building clash between the President and the speaker -- which saw Trump storm out of White House talks with a parting shot of \"Bye-bye\" last week -- is more than a personal grudge match. ","While it appears trivial, the confrontation is effectively the first battle in an era-defining duel that could decide the fate of the Trump presidency.","The President badly needs to win the first face-off with the leader of a new Democratic-led House that must already have him dreaming of the lost days of a tame Republican power monopoly on Capitol Hill. With special counsel Robert Mueller closing in and a re-election race looming, he badly needs his base. And his base badly wants his wall.","Pelosi has no desire to cave in her first engagement with Trump. She has an advantage in that she's been toe-to-toe with a Republican President before, during her first spell running the House opposite George W. Bush.","The speaker is a veteran Washington hand and, as her crushing of a Democratic revolt after the midterm elections showed, she understands her power and knows how to use it more effectively than a President who is a still a relative political novice.","And more than that, Pelosi is getting under Trump's skin and seems intent on goading him into counterproductive lashing out.","The eye-for-an-eye skirmishing is certainly undignified.","Sen. Lisa Murkowski surveyed the political game playing Thursday and concluded that after 27 days, the public would soon have enough.","\"They say ... 'You may not like one another but when are you going to figure out how to work together?' \" the Alaska Republican said.","Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who's usually a staunch Trump ally, said: \"One sophomoric response does not deserve another.\"","Trump thinks he's winning the shutdown","Trump has been frustrated by the tone of shutdown coverage, asking why it seemed Democrats had the upper hand, when in his view he is winning the standoff, CNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Thursday.","The White House felt wrong-footed after Pelosi released a letter Wednesday calling for Trump to reschedule his big TV moment -- the State of the Union address on January 29 -- because of the partial government shutdown.","Thursday's glimpse into the West Wing was revealing because it suggests that the President believes he is heading for victory in the shutdown even though most outside analysis and evidence suggests Pelosi is coming out ahead.","One Trump adviser told CNN's Jim Acosta that the President believed Pelosi would eventually fold in their \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" face-off.","But most polling shows that Americans blame the President for initiating a shutdown that he had said on television before Christmas he would be \"proud\" to own. And a majority of the public still opposes his border wall.","Trump also failed to turn the political tide with an Oval Office address and a trip to the border on Air Force One.","The White House has been making a fair point that Pelosi has not shown any sign of bending in the talks, either. But it has failed to capitalize on what some observers saw as an error by the speaker when she described a border wall as an \"immorality\" -- language that might jar with conservative Democrats.","Thursday's events offered hints as to why Trump may in the end regret walking into this confrontation.","In a letter to Pelosi, in which his glee at one-upmanship jumped off the page, the President told the speaker he was \"sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed.\" ","It was the kind of unpredictable coup that Trump's supporters  love and that burnishes his image as a slayer of establishment protocol.","Yet while his strike against Pelosi was immediately celebrated by his pundit cheerleaders on Twitter, it was characteristically Trumpian in that while it felt good at the time, it appeared strategically suspect in the longer term.","Amanda Carpenter, a former senior communications adviser to GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said it wasn't clear that the White House could turns its retaliation against Pelosi into a breakthrough in the shutdown stalemate.","\"They cannot solve the problem, so it's much easier to play petty, partisan politics. This is a move that will be effective at convincing the base that they are yet again owning the libs, but show me how it gets you to a deal,\" Carpenter said on CNN's \"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\"'","If Trump had any moral high ground following Pelosi's stifling of the State of the Union address, it quickly crumbled after he canceled her trip.","After all, the speaker had been poised to lead a delegation of US lawmakers to meet troops serving in a war zone that Trump has yet to visit, allowing Democrats to paint the President as hardhearted and blocking congressional oversight of the war.","In a questionable flexing of his powers as commander in chief, Trump had shattered security protocols requiring that details of a senior official's travel to Afghanistan, where insurgents and terrorist groups are active, to be kept secret until they land.","He faced charges of hypocrisy since the Air Force had flown him to his first visit as President to a war zone -- in Iraq -- in December, when the shutdown was in its early days.","Trump's remark that Pelosi could fly commercial came across as irresponsible given that she is second in line to the presidency, after the vice president. And his use of the word \"excursion\" suggested he views trips to the troops as PR stunts.","An unfavorable media reaction to his jab at Pelosi on Thursday may have prompted Trump to quickly cancel a planned trip by his high-powered delegation of Cabinet officers to the World Economic Forum, a gathering of the world's globalist elite in Davos, Switzerland, in the next few days.","The trip, which Trump himself had originally been expected to lead, deprived his administration of a chance to wallow in the glory of the strong US economy among some of his most committed critics in Europe.","'Fifth-grade behavior'","Trump's cancellation of Pelosi's trip also offered an open invitation to Democrats to claim political points by slamming him as \"petty\" and \"small,\" lacking the dignity required of a President.","\"I can say that all too often in the last two years the President has acted like he is in the fifth grade,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff of California. \"To have someone who has that kind of character running the country is an enormous problem at every level.\"","Generally, enemies who take on Trump directly tend not to prosper, since there is no one better at knuckle-duster politics than the President -- as a supposedly golden generation of GOP candidates found out in 2016.","Pelosi, though, has been picking her spots. It often seems she takes personal shots at the President to goad him into ill-considered retaliation.","In a shot at Trump's claim to be a self-made billionaire after failed White House shutdown talks, she said federal workers lacking paychecks could not \"just ask their father for more money.\"","Last month, after tense Oval Office talks, Pelosi mocked the President's tough guy image by telling Democrats the wall is \"like a manhood thing for him, as if manhood could ever be associated with him.\"","Republicans have long seen Pelosi -- who they delight in branding as a rich, radical liberal and a hypocrite -- as a poor-polling liability for Democrats, especially in tight congressional races in territory that favors conservatives.","But so far in the new era of divided Washington government, she seems more at ease than the President. ","And their clashes, which predate a rigorous effort by Democratic committee chairs to expose what they believe is corruption, incompetence and possibly illegality at the heart of the administration, appear like the opening salvos of a calculated bid to lure the President to his own political destruction.","Trump needs to dig deep to turn the tables.","---"],"1":["(CNN) - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office says she was forced to nix her Afghanistan trip after President Donald Trump barred her from using a military aircraft and she was told by the State Department diplomatic security that it was too dangerous to fly there commercially.","Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill released a statement Friday saying that while Pelosi and the congressional delegation set to travel with her were prepared to use commercial travel for their trip, the risks associated with the trip only grew after details of those plans to a war zone leaked.","\"In the middle of the night, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service provided an updated threat assessment detailing that the President announcing this sensitive travel had significantly increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops, security, and other officials supporting the trip,\" Hammill said. \"This morning, we learned that the administration had leaked the commercial travel plans as well.\"","The canceled Afghanistan trip marked an escalation in a weeks-long standoff between Pelosi and the President over the government shutdown. On Wednesday, Pelosi sent a letter to the President asking him to consider moving his State of the Union address or to deliver it in writing -- citing security concerns because some of the agencies tasked with protecting the event are affected by the on going shutdown. On Thursday, Trump retaliated, blocking Pelosi and members of Congress from using a military jet for a trip they had planned to take to Afghanistan to visit American troops.","\"In light of the grave threats caused by the President's action, the delegation has decided to postpone the trip so as not to further endanger our troops and security personnel, or the other travelers on the flights,\" Hammill said.  \"Whether here or abroad, the Speaker always thanks our troops, diplomats and intelligence community for their heroism and service.  The Speaker commends her colleagues on the delegation, who personally and officially have dedicated their lives to protect and defend the American people.\"","---"],"2":["(CNN) - Speaker Nancy Pelosi canceled a planned trip to visit troops in Afghanistan Friday, after -- her office alleged in a statement -- the White House leaked the details of the congressional delegation's commercial plane travel.","\"In the middle of the night, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service provided an updated threat assessment detailing that the President announcing this sensitive travel had significantly increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops, security, and other officials supporting the trip,\" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said. \"This morning, we learned that the administration had leaked the commercial travel plans as well.\"","Which, to borrow the parlance of the Internet, is VERY big, if true.","It's one thing for Trump, as he did on Thursday, to rescind the military plane Pelosi and the rest of her colleagues were planning to fly on as a way of exacting revenge on her for asking the President to delay his planned \"State of the Union\" speech on January 29. To do so publicly -- White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted out the letter Trump sent to Pelosi -- is to raise the stakes. To leak commercial travel plans to make absolutely certain that Pelosi can't go on the trip is a bridge even further.","Now, to be clear, this is an allegation made by Pelosi without corroboration to date. And, the White House denies it. \"When the Speaker of the House and about 20 others from Capitol Hill decide to book their own commercial flights to Afghanistan, the world is going to find out,\" a White House official told CNN's Sarah Westwood and Kevin Liptak. \"The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is a flat out lie.\"","Hammill countered with a tweet, saying, \"Multiple admin sources were telling Hill reporters early this morning that the Speaker Pelosi delegation was flying commercially.\"","Of course, if it's clear that Trump's White House didn't do what Pelosi's office is alleging, it could boomerang back on her.","But this charge isn't being made by just anyone. The allegation that the White House leaked information about their travel plans is coming from the speaker of the House. Presumably, Pelosi's office wouldn't make such a serious allegation -- essentially that the White House is endangering members of Congress (and the troops they would be visiting) -- if they didn't feel pretty damn sure about it.","So here we are. The White House will HAVE to say something about all of this. Is Pelosi's office right that the Diplomatic Security Service said in a threat assessment that Trump had \"significantly increased the danger to the delegation and to the troops?\" Did someone in the White House find out about Pelosi's commercial flight plans and leak them? ","Was that done to make sure she couldn't go to Afghanistan amid the now 28-day-long government shutdown?","Regardless of what the White House says -- or, knowing this White House, what they don't say -- Pelosi's allegation amounts to a ramping-up of tensions, which were already very, very high, between the speaker and the President.","We've spent this week spectating a tit-for-tat battle between two of the most powerful people in the country that has significantly dimmed the prospect of ending this longest government shutdown in political history.","In order for deals to get done, for compromise to be possible, you need trust. One side has to believe that they can take the word of the other side. That if the White House says they will do something, then congressional Democrats can depend on it getting done.","Right now, there is zero trust between the two sides. Pelosi is alleging that Trump's White House, out of pure vengeance, leaked information that put her and others members of Congress in jeopardy. The Trump White House is calling those allegations a \"flat out lie.\"","The well isn't just poisoned. It's poisoned, set on fire and collapsed.","Which is bad news for the 800,000 federal workers who have been either furloughed or working without pay for a month now. ","And for the rest of us too, who are watching our government's slow-motion failure right in front of our eyes.","---"],"3":["(CNN) - Less than 24 hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told President Donald Trump that he should reconsider delivering his State of the Union on January 29, the famed counter-puncher struck back. Bigly.","\"Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed,\" Trump wrote to Pelosi in a letter tweeted by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders Thursday afternoon. \"In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.\"","And then, this dagger: \"Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.\"","Oh, it is ON.","(That line is very likely an intentional echo of Pelosi's Wednesday letter to Trump, in which she said of the President's State of the Union address: \"He can make it from the Oval Office if he wants.\")","Knowing what we know about Trump -- he is thin-skinned, easy to anger and will never let a slight go unanswered -- his reaction shouldn't be surprising. This is who he is! This is what he does!","And yet, even by those incredibly low expectations, Trump's move was striking.","Pelosi was set to leave later Thursday on the CODEL, short for a congressional delegation traveling abroad. Trump canceled it by disallowing Pelosi to use a military aircraft for the trip. (The White House oversees the use of military aircraft by elected officials.) \"Nancy Pelosi and Democrats were guaranteeing that 800,000 people were going to lose their paychecks today,\" a White House official told CNN's Jeremy Diamond by way of justification.","So while people on TV Thursday morning were talking about how surprising it was that Trump had yet to respond to Pelosi, the President was busy in his lab cooking this gem up. Proving, yet again, that there is no road too low for him to take -- although, admittedly, the offer for Pelosi to make the trip by flying commercial is an epic troll move.","To be clear: Pelosi is far from blameless here. Her move to deny Trump his platform for the annual \"State of the Union\" address -- which she couched in concerns over the ability of the Secret Service to ensure everyone's safety amid the 27-days-and-counting government shutdown -- was a totally political move designed to embarrass the President.","Pelosi's decision, like Trump's on the CODEL, was within her powers to do. (The speaker of the House invites the President to address a bicameral session of Congress. The President's only role is to accept or reject the ask.) But just because the two principals can do what they've done doesn't mean they should do it.","As a reminder: 800,000 federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay today. And they have been doing so for the last (almost) month. Bills aren't being paid. Sacrifices are being made. Real life is happening.","Amid that backdrop, the childish one-upmanship between Trump and Pelosi feels deeply out of touch. But, more than that, it's actively detrimental to the re-opening of the government. No one can argue that the actions of Trump and Pelosi over the last 24 hours have brought us closer to compromise that would re-open the government. Hell, no one can even argue that what's happened between two of the most powerful people in the country has had a neutral impact on the shutdown showdown. This is a bad thing for the country. Period.","What's even more terrifying -- and depressing -- is that neither side seems likely to play the adult in this back-and-forth anytime soon.","Pelosi sees a Democratic base that is entirely uninterested in giving Trump his border wall and a series of national polls that suggest the public blames the President and his party more than congressional Democrats for the ongoing shutdown. Combine those two factors, and Pelosi has zero incentive to give in to Trump.","Trump, of course, has made a political career of doing just this -- smashing through normal behavior, acting impulsively and impetuously, taking his ball and going home when he doesn't get exactly what he wants. If Pelosi's political calculations make her unlikely to take the high road any time soon, Trump's personality doesn't even allow him to see that a high road exists. ","Which leaves us absolutely nowhere. Our elected officials are acting like my two sons, who are 9 and 6. Everything is the other person's fault. They did it first. What could I do but react?","As any parent -- or, really, any adult -- will tell you, it's easy to get caught in that blame game. But it is also a cul-de-sac from which no solutions emerge. It's bad enough when we are talking about a game between my boys on the Nintendo Switch. It's unimaginable when we are talking about the shuttered federal government.","\"One sophomoric response does not deserve another,\" said Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in a statement criticizing Trump's move.","Amen. Unfortunately, at this point in the game, calling what Trump and Pelosi are doing \"sophomoric\" may be paying them too high a compliment.","---"],"4":["(CNN) - For much of the past 20 months, President Donald Trump and his administration have insisted that, for all of the smoke surrounding his 2016 campaign, there was no fire. A lot of people in Trump's orbit engaging in conversations and relationships with Russian officials, but no evidence of collusion and certainly nothing that linked Donald Trump to any wrongdoing.","That very well might have changed Thursday night, with this report from BuzzFeed: ","\"President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to two federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter.","\"Trump also supported a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, in order to personally meet President Vladimir Putin and jump-start the tower negotiations. 'Make it happen,' the sources said Trump told Cohen.\"","The BuzzFeed story also claims that Cohen confirmed this information to special counsel Robert Mueller after \"the special counsel's office learned about Trump's directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\"","It's hard to overstate what a big deal that is. No other major outlets have confirmed the BuzzFeed report. But if the BuzzFeed report is right, then the President of the United States directed an underling to lie under oath -- which is, in and of itself, a crime. ","Don't take my word for it. Check out this exchange between Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Attorney General nominee William Barr during his confirmation hearings earlier this week (hat tip to Washington Post's Jacqueline Alemany for flagging):","Klobuchar: The President persuading a person to commit perjury would be obstruction, is that right? ","Barr: Well, yes. Well, any person who persuades another to -- yeah.\"","Klobuchar: \"You also said that a President or any person convincing a witness to change testimony would be obstruction, is that right? ","Barr: Yes.\"","Which, well, that was sort of on point, no?","Ask yourself this: Why, if there was nothing worrisome or untoward about Trump's dealings with Russia, would he instruct Cohen to lie to about the depth and breadth of the conversations between the Trumps and the Russians regarding a potential construction project in Moscow? You don't have to lie or cover up things that are no big deal, right?","And we know from Cohen that he not only lied to the special counsel's office about Trump Tower Moscow but did so because he believed the truthful details of how long the conversations with Russians over the project went on (until June 2016, according to Cohen) and the involvement of the Trump family (Cohen said he repeatedly briefed them on developments) might jeopardize the billionaire businessman's chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination.","The Trump response to all of this? To attack Cohen. \"If you believe Cohen I can get you a great deal on the Brooklyn Bridge,\" Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told The New York Times' Maggie Haberman on Thursday night after the news broke.","The problem for Giuliani is that the BuzzFeed report doesn't hinge on Cohen. It says that the special counsel unearthed the evidence that Trump had told Cohen to lie through \"multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\" Mueller's office only went to Cohen to confirm\/admit he actually did it. The special counsel's office didn't get the information from Cohen. That fact makes Giuliani's claim that Cohen is a proven liar -- which he is! -- largely meaningless.","If the BuzzFeed report is true (and yes that remains an \"if\" since CNN has not corroborated the reporting), then the entire Russia conversation changes. As Barr helpfully noted earlier this week, the President telling someone who works for him to lie to Congress about an ongoing investigation is obstruction of justice. And obstruction of justice is a crime.","The question is where Mueller would go next, assuming he has the goods on Trump for obstruction. Giuliani has repeatedly insisted that Mueller's team has told the Trump lawyers that they believe they cannot indict a sitting president. ","\"All they get to do is write a report,\" Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash in May 2017. \"They can't indict. At least they acknowledged that to us after some battling, they acknowledged that to us.\"","Let's assume that's true -- although to do that it means we take Giuliani's word for it, which, given his recent \"no collusion\" flip-flop, might be a dicey proposition.) What that means is that Mueller's report will likely move through political channels rather than legal one. So rather than an indictment, perhaps impeachment.","\"If true  -- and proof must be examined -- Congress must begin impeachment proceedings and Barr must refer, at a minimum, the relevant portions of material discovered by Mueller,\" tweeted former Attorney General Eric Holder. \"This is a potential inflection point.\"","Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse agreed, tweeting, \"If this is true, this is plain, slam-dunk, criminal obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1505, 1512), subornation of perjury (18 U.S.C. 1622), conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371) and likely aiding and abetting perjury (18 U.S.C. 2).\"","The \"if true\" part is, of course, the key. BuzzFeed has put the credibility of its entire organization on the line here. To make an allegation that the President of the United States purposely obstructed justice in an investigation into Russia's attempts to interfere in a presidential election is a massive deal -- and the sort of thing that, if wrong, can do irreparable damage to a company's reputation.","But if the BuzzFeed article is right -- and one of the reporters who bylined the story insisted on CNN Friday morning that the information in the piece is \"rock solid\" and that the sourcing \"goes beyond\" the two sources cited -- then this is the smoking gun (or at least a smoking gun).","If Mueller has the goods -- as the BuzzFeed report suggests he does -- then it is very, very hard to see how impeachment proceedings won't be started in the House once the special counsel report comes out. Whether Trump is actually removed from office is a more political question that depends on how clear -- if at all -- Trump's culpability is in the Mueller report.  ","Make no mistake: This is a very big moment in an investigation seemingly stuffed full of them. And, for students of history, you'll remember that the first article of impeachment against then-President Richard Nixon was that he had obstructed justice by ordering others to lie.

","Since it was published, the story has dominated cable news and caught the eye of Congressional Democrats. In a tweet, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said his committee would \"get to the bottom of it.\"","Leopold and Cormier have broken a number of major stories on Trump Tower and Russia that have proven true. But the intense attention to their latest scoop has also resurfaced Leopold's checkered past.","Leopold, a former Los Angeles Times, Dow Jones, and Vice News reporter who has been at BuzzFeed since 2017, was involved in several major scandals that called into question the veracity of his reporting during George W.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, directly asked Barr whether persuading anybody to commit perjury would be obstruction of justice. Barr said \"yes,\" adding, \"any person who persuades another\" would do so.","Klobuchar's questions focused on the portion of Barr's memo that said it \"appears\" Mueller is investigating a possible obstruction case based on Trump asking Comey to drop his investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn and later firing Comey. Barr then suggested Mueller's obstruction inquiry \"would have potentially disastrous implications\" and said that the special counsel \"should not be permitted to demand that the President submit to interrogation about alleged obstruction.\"","\"Obviously, the President and any other official can commit obstruction in this classic sense of sabotaging a proceeding's truth-finding function,\" Barr wrote then. \"Thus, for example, if a President knowingly destroys or alters evidence, suborns perjury, or induces a witness to change testimony, or commits any act deliberately impairing the integrity or availability of evidence, then he, like anyone else, commits the crime of obstruction.\"","\"The President, as far as I know, is not being accused of engaging in any wrongful act of evidence impairment,\" he added.","The law enforcement officials told BuzzFeed that Trump directed Cohen to claim negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow ended months earlier than they actually did.

In a single answer to a question about the Mueller probe last January, for example, Trump unleashed an epic seven(!) \"no collusion\" assertions. Here's just a piece of that (bolding mine): ","\"Well, again John, there has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians or Trump and Russians. No collusion. When I watch you interviewing all the people leaving their committees, I mean, the Democrats are all running for office, trying to say this that -- but bottom line, they all say there's no collusion. And there is no collusion.\"","Trump's Twitter feed, too, is choked with \"no collusion\" talk. According to the indispensable Trump Twitter Archive, Trump has tweeted the words \"no collusion\" 60 separate times, with the first coming on May 12, 2017 and the most recent happening on January 6.","All of which brings me to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday night. And these lines from Giuliani, in particular: ","\"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign. I said the President of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the President of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC.\"","Here's the thing: Giuliani -- as Cuomo pointed out in the moment -- is 100% wrong about, well, all of it.","A quick search on my Google machine turned up this gem from an appearance by Giuliani on Fox News in July 2018:","Fox News' Guy Benson: \"Regardless of whether collusion would be a crime, is it still the position of you and your client that there was no collusion with the Russians whatsoever on behalf of the Trump campaign?\"","Giuliani: \"Correct.\"","Pretty cut and dry, no? ","There's no question Giuliani is lying about his own past statements -- not to mention those of the President and lots and lots of his advisers -- about the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. The real question is: Why?","And the answer is, well, circumstances have changed. When Giuliani started claiming that there was \"no collusion\" between the campaign and the Russians, we didn't know that campaign chairman Paul Manafort had not only met with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russia with ties to the country's intelligence service, but had shared polling data on the 2016 race. Or that Kilimnik is a focus of Mueller's probe.","The simple reality is that, given those two pieces of information, it is very, very hard for Giuliani (or Trump) to stand by their \"NO COLLUSION\" mantra. If what Manafort did isn't collusion -- and we don't even know the full extent of it -- then it is very damn close. ","And so, Giuliani is engaging in a full-blown effort to move the goalposts. This was never a debate about whether ANYONE in Trump's campaign orbit colluded with the Russians! This has always been about whether Trump himself colluded. And he didn't! We win!","That spin doesn't comport with known facts. And scads of audio and video clips of Trump, Giuliani and plenty of other Trump administration officials saying that there was no collusion between the campaign and the Russians.","But to Giuliani -- and Trump -- it may not matter. Remember that what the two of them have long been doing is not trying to fight the legal battle over the Mueller investigation, but rather the political one. Why? Because, ultimately, Trump's fate will be decided by politicians, not lawyers.  ","Mueller has already made clear, at least according to Giuliani, that he does not believe he can indict a sitting president. So even if he finds evidence of wrongdoing by the President -- like, say, directing and coordinating hush money payments to two women alleging affairs with him as a way to improve his chances of being elected -- there is not likely to be any sort of legal movement as long as Trump is in office. ","The impact of the Mueller report is almost certainly to be felt primarily in the political realm. Impeachment is the thing that is most dangerous to Trump if the Mueller report is deeply damning, and that is a political process running through the House and Senate. Given that, what Giuliani and Trump are trying to do is massage public opinion -- particularly among the President's supporters -- in hopes that no matter what Mueller's report says, they can convince people who back the President that this is all a nothing burger.","If, say, Mueller finds collusion but not by Trump, the President and Giuliani will now say: We told you! No collusion between Trump and the Russians. This is all one big witch hunt! Mueller didn't find anything.","That spin would, of course, miss this key point: Mueller would have found collusion between a major party presidential campaign and an adversarial foreign power. Which, in the understatement of the century, would be a VERY big deal.","But in the world of Trump and Rudy, none of that would matter. If Trump could maintain some level of credibility with his base, it would make it that much harder for GOP lawmakers -- especially in the Senate -- to turn on him in impeachment proceedings.","None of that, however, should excuse what Giuliani was up to on Wednesday night. He was purposely trying to rewrite the history of his defense of the President of the United States in an ongoing investigation into how Russia sought to influence a national election on US soil. ","Sit with that for a minute.","---"],"11":["(CNN) - Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that he never denied President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, only that the President himself was not involved in collusion.","In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"Cuomo Prime Time,\" Giuliani, a former New York mayor and Trump's attorney, said he doesn't know if other people in the campaign, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were working with the Kremlin during the 2016 presidential race.","\"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign,\" Giuliani said.","He added, \"I said the President of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the President of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC.\"","It's another remarkable statement from Giuliani, given that the President and his supporters have repeatedly denied any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. A person familiar with the matter told CNN last week that Manafort, while serving as Trump's campaign chairman, tried to send internal polling data from the Trump campaign with two Kremlin-supporting Ukrainian oligarchs through his associate Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national who is linked to Russian intelligence.","When Cuomo asked if Manafort sharing such data with foreign agents constituted collusion, Giuliani said Trump never shared the polling data himself and only found out about it recently in the news.","\"Donald Trump wasn't giving polling data to anyone,\" Giuliani said, adding, \"he did not know about it until it was revealed a few weeks ago in an article.\"","Giuliani attempted Thursday morning to clean up his remarks, telling CNN's Dana Bash that he did not intend to send any new signals regarding the Trump legal team's understanding of the investigation.","\"The President did not himself, nor does he have any knowledge of collusion with Russians. If anyone was doing that, he is unaware of it and so am I,\" Giuliani said. \"But neither he nor I can possibly know what everyone on the campaign was doing.\" ","Giuliani said collusion is not a crime and the term is now being used broadly to describe contact with Russians. ","\"I can't possibly say no one had contact about something or in some way,\" he said.","Frequent denials by Trump","Trump himself has tweeted at least 13 times directly saying there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The latest such denial came on December 10.","\"Democrats can't find a Smocking (sic) Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey's testimony. No Smocking (sic) Gun...No Collusion.' @FoxNews. That's because there was NO COLLUSION. So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,\" Trump tweeted, referencing a quote that was said on Fox News. ","The President reacting to a filing in the court case of his former attorney, Michael Cohen, and the money paid to two women during the 2016 campaign who allege they've had extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied both allegations.","Trump later added, \"Which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama's - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!\"","In the interview with Cuomo, Giuliani challenged special counsel Robert Mueller to provide evidence of wrongdoing by the President.","\"Let's see if he's got anything -- I challenge him to show us some evidence that the President was involved in anything approaching criminal conduct,\" Giuliani said. ","He added, \"If you want to do an ethics investigation fine, do an ethics investigation. But you don't need a special prosecutor for that.\"","Later in the interview, Giuliani shot down reports that he had said Trump's legal team should get to edit Mueller's report before it goes public.","Giuliani told Cuomo that he only meant Trump's legal team should get to see Mueller's final report before it goes public in order to write a response, but stressed that he does not want to alter the report and supports as much of it being published as national security allows.","\"Of course I should (be able to view it first), I should be allowed to respond,\" Giuliani said, adding that \"it's fair that we get an opportunity to do that.\"","\"I don't want to change the report, I want to respond to the report,\" he added. ","Giuliani said that he would ideally like the report to be published unredacted so that he and fellow Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow could provide a complete counterargument, and that he would not be able to edit the report regardless.","\"As his lawyer, I'd honestly like you to see the whole report because I think Jay and I could knock the hell out of it,\" he said.","\"First of all, they wouldn't let me change the report. Secondly; I've been a lawyer too long to think I'd ever do that. Third, I want them to write the garbage they're going to write because I want to answer it,\" Giuliani added.","---"],"12":["Editor's Note: Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor, is a CNN legal analyst and a Rutgers University scholar. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.","(CNN) - Ever since special counsel Robert Mueller began his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, public interest in the law, crime and justice has surged. Over the past few months, I've received countless questions -- creative, unexpected, brilliant and challenging -- from viewers and readers. People are keenly interested in learning about our legal system, perhaps like never before.  ","So as an experiment for the next few weeks, I'm going to be fielding questions sent in via Twitter (@eliehonig) and email (CNN.Opinion@turner.com). In 14 years as a prosecutor, I did my share of witness examinations. Some were explosive; others were quietly effective, and still others were duds. (No, I never got anyone to break and confess to a crime on the stand, Colonel Jessup-\"You can't handle the truth!\"-style). Now, though, I'll be on the witness stand, and you'll be grilling me. No rules of evidence, no objections, no holding back. Ask whatever you want, and I'll give you the truth. (You can handle it.)","And what a week for legal news: Rudy Giuliani took to CNN on Wednesday night to unveil his newest line of defense: \"I never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign. ... I have not. I said the President of the United States.\" First, it simply isn't true. Donald Trump himself has tweeted more than a dozen times  denying any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Make no mistake: This is a strategic surrender by Giuliani. ","Good defense lawyers constantly survey the landscape to determine what can be credibly denied and what cannot. And as the evidence mounts that many of Trump's closest advisers colluded with Russia -- most recently, the revelation that former campaign chair Paul Manafort shared sensitive internal polling data with Russian oligarchs, through a suspected Russian intelligence agent -- Giuliani must now realize he cannot continue to issue blanket denials of campaign collusion. So he gives up some tactical ground, trying to build a last-stand fortress around the only person to whom he owes any allegiance -- his client, the President of the United States.","The Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, who assured the American people of his independence -- notwithstanding his prior attacks on Mueller's obstruction theory as \"fatally misconceived,\" \"asinine\" and at risk of \"taking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president.\" While Barr assured the Senate that Mueller will be permitted to finish his investigation, he left open the possibility that he might hold back Mueller's final report from the public, instead issuing his own high-level summary of its conclusions. ","We also learned that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation of Trump to determine whether he was an agent (witting or unwitting) of Russia and that Trump allegedly took steps to conceal the substance of his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The seemingly never-ending stalemate between Mueller and Giuliani over an interview of Trump somehow got even staler, potentially setting the stage for a subpoena battle. And Michael Cohen agreed to spill it publicly before the House.  ","Your questions","Here are some of the questions you sent in:","Jayne:  He (Giuliani) admitted the campaign manager was colluding with the Russians, but Trump didn't know???","Your use of three question marks nicely captures the spirit of incredulity one feels when applying basic common sense to Giuliani's latest defense of Trump. Here's what we already know for sure: At least 16 Trump associates had contact with Russians during the campaign or transition, virtually all of them lied about those contacts, and many of them (Manafort, Cohen, Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos) have been convicted of federal crimes. ","We also know the Russians tried to help Trump win the election by hacking and publishing emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign and allied groups and by engineering fraudulent social media campaigns. So the million-dollar question now is whether Mueller can prove that Trump participated in or knew about the collusion. I think a juror, or any rational person assessing the facts, would have a hard time even based on what we know right now believing that Trump somehow was in the dark about what seemingly everybody around him was doing to help him win. And as we learn more from Mueller in upcoming weeks, the \"blame everybody else but not me\" strategy is going to become even more difficult to buy.","Cathie: Sir, sounds like Barr in his testimony is saying Mueller will submit his report to Barr, who then will write his own report. Quite frankly, I don't give a damn what Barr has to say! Does Congress have any recourse as to seeing the entire, unedited Mueller report?","I've been in the room preparing people for confirmation hearings, and the two most important pieces of advice are (1) be boring and (2) commit to nothing. On (1), Barr aced it -- he was dull, bland and created no seriously damaging headlines -- in contrast, for example, to Brett Kavanaugh. (General rule of thumb: If they do a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch about you, you haven't been boring enough.) On (2), it's all about flexibility, and Barr left himself plenty by saying he believed the Mueller report should be seen by the public, but \"subject to applicable regulations and laws.\"","As attorney general, Barr must do exactly that. But there's almost unlimited flexibility in what that means. Here's an example: What happens if Trump, through Giuliani, invokes executive privilege to argue that portions of the report should be redacted? Will Barr make his own redactions based on his view of executive privilege? Will he let Giuliani review it and make redactions? Will he fight in court if they disagree? In that sense, Barr has left the door open to almost any possibility -- including the possibility that the American people will never see Mueller's report, but rather only Barr's own summary of its conclusions.  ","If Barr fails to turn over the report or major portions of it to Congress, the House Democrats will fight like mad. If that happens, we will see an executive privilege battle to rival the 1974 Richard Nixon case. I don't like Trump's chances in that legal fight. In an 8-0 ruling, the Supreme Court unanimously shot down Nixon's executive privilege claim. Given that legal precedent, Trump would be fighting an uphill battle here.","Speaking of executive privilege. ...","Clarence: Can you comment on the application\/limits of executive privilege ... in the context of the President's nonpublic communications with a foreign head of state?","House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has stated his intent to subpoena the interpreter who was at Trump's Helsinki meeting with Putin. (Schiff sure is enjoying his newfound subpoena power.) Trump's best and perhaps only recourse is to assert executive privilege over his conversation with Putin. This one is tricky. On one hand, executive privilege is intended to shield private conversations between the President and his advisers -- counsel, chief of staff, Cabinet members, etc. It would be a dramatic and unlikely extension of executive privilege to cover foreign heads of state -- particularly heads of hostile foreign states, such as Putin.","That said, Trump could have a compelling policy argument: If interpreters can be subpoenaed to testify publicly about meetings with foreign leaders, those foreign leaders will be reluctant or unwilling to meet with the President. There are legitimate reasons why those conversations, such as the President's internal discussions with his advisers, should remain confidential.  ","Ryan:  Will the (President's) interview with Jeanine Pirro affect him citing executive privilege in the future? He said that the notes (from his meeting with Putin in Helsinki) are open for grabs and he could care less if we saw them. ","Good catch -- you have a future as an investigator. Anytime a person holds a privilege -- for example, attorney-client privilege, doctor-patient privilege or spousal privilege -- it can be \"waived\" or essentially given up. So, a smart prosecutor (or member of Congress) could use Trump's quote -- \"Anybody could have listened to that meeting, that meeting is up for grabs\" -- here to argue that he has waived any privilege claim. Trump's only response then would be, \"Yeah, just kidding, I said that on Fox News, but it's not my position here in court.\" Not exactly the strongest hand to play.","Victoria: Can the President of the United States be arrested while in office?","There are two important issues here. One, will Mueller bring criminal charges against Trump while he is President? Almost certainly not. Justice Department policy advises against indicting a sitting president, and Mueller is the ultimate by-the-book guy. It would take a change to the department's policy and approval from the attorney general (Matthew Whitaker now, likely Barr upon confirmation) to indict the President. Highly doubtful, particularly given that Barr testified he saw no reason to change the policy.","But the second question is can a sitting president be indicted? That's an unknown. The Justice Department policy is just that -- a policy. It's not part of the Constitution; it's not a statute, and it doesn't come from a prior court decision.  And I know firsthand that Justice Department policies come and go.","In my time as a federal prosecutor, we saw the department create, amend and withdraw many internal policies. So, this policy could be changed or withdrawn with the stroke of a pen. The issue has never been tested in the courts, and respected scholars --- including an adviser to then-independent counsel Ken Starr -- have concluded that a sitting president can be indicted. Someday this question may go to the courts, and it will be fascinating to see what happens.    ","Tessa: Do hearsay rules change under a criminal conspiracy? How will that affect Cohen's testimony in front of Congress?","First, hearsay rules do not apply to statements made in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy. And second, hearsay rules apply in court but not in congressional hearings -- one of many reasons the Cohen testimony is going to make a circus look orderly by comparison.","Got more questions? Send them to CNN.Opinion@turner.com.  ","My 3 questions to watch for next week","1. Does Giuliani's latest line of defense foreshadow new announcements from Mueller?  ","2. Will Mueller decide he's had enough of Giuliani's dancing on the interview issue and subpoena the President?  ","3.  Will Schiff subpoena the interpreter who was present when Trump met with Putin?","---"],"13":["Washington  (CNN) - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made no comments during a camera spray at the top of his meeting with North Korea's Kim Yong Chol at a Washington hotel.

","Whether the meeting happens or not will depend on how things go with Secretary Pompeo and could involve handing over Kim Jong Un's letter. It's not expected to be a substantive meeting with Trump but rather a \"drop by\" of sorts.","Kim Yong Chol last came to the United States in June. He visited New York and met with Pompeo before traveling to Washington, where he delivered an oversized envelope containing a letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump in the Oval Office.

","Six high-quality polls have been released this week touching on Trump, the shutdown, the Democrats in Congress and the wall.","Most confirmed what we already knew from before the shutdown started: Opposition to a border wall is widespread and deep. But beyond that general opposition, the new polls offer some consistent results, including:","     \u2022 Blame, in the public's mind, rests largely at the White House \n     \u2022 Many object to the shutdown, especially as a tactic to build the wall, \n     \u2022 Few see a wall as an effective way to combat undocumented immigration.","About half of Americans (51%) said it would be unacceptable if the only way to end the shutdown was to pass a bill that includes Trump's requested funding for the border wall, according to a Pew Research Center poll released on Wednesday. On the other side, 29% said it would be unacceptable for the only end to the shutdown to come via a bill that does not include the president's requested funding for the wall.","Multiple other polls show similar sentiments, including a Quinnipiac University finding that 61% of voters would support a bill funding new border security measures without funding a wall, including 36% of Republicans, 78% of Democrats and two-thirds of independents. ","Seven-in-ten Americans said that shutting down the federal government in order to reach an agreement on government policy is a bad strategy and only 22% thought it was a good strategy, according to a PBS NewsHour\/Marist poll. ","So, Americans oppose the strategy of shutting down the government, but is that because of the wall itself? Or the government? Probably both. ","Support for the wall is still low, at around four-in-ten, across all the polls (40% support in Pew, 43% in Quinnipiac, 39% in CNN\/SSRS and 42% in ABC\/Washington Post). ","Further, the Pew survey found that only about a third of Americans (34%) said that expanding the wall would lead to a major reduction in illegal immigration to the US and, according to Quinnipiac's poll, 43% of voters feel a wall is an effective way to protect the border. Both polls found sharp partisan divides on the matter: In the Pew study, 69% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said it would reduce illegal immigration vs. just 7% among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, and Quinnipiac's results show 87% of Republicans consider the wall effective protection for the border, while 95% of Democrats say it is not.","It's becoming clear that the shutdown is an issue for American's perceptions of the government. In a Gallup poll released Wednesday, the number who cited the government as the most important problem facing the country today went up from 19% in December to 29% in January. But even this is driven by partisanship. In the Pew poll, 79% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the government shutdown is a \"very serious\" problem for the country, just 35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents feel the same.","Majorities disapprove of the way Trump (61%), Republicans in Congress (60%) and Democrats in Congress (53%) are handling negotiations over the shutdown, according to Pew Research.","And most Americans are blaming Trump for the shutdown. In each of four polls that asked respondents to place blame, majorities said that lies with the President, while about a third in each cited Democrats in Congress as primarily responsible.","The President's overall approval has definitely taken a hit, too. Not all polls showed a substantial downturn from where he was in December to where he is now, but taken together there is clear downward movement in his ratings. One of his biggest losses has been among white Americans without college degrees, an important base for Trump. In the new polls, four surveys conducted among all adults found approval ratings below 40%. Back in December, before the shutdown began, polls conducted using the same methodology found a wider range of approval ratings, including several over 40%. Each of those findings on their own wouldn't amount to much, but the consensus across polls suggests real movement in the public opinion.","---"],"15":["(CNN) - Here is a list from CNN reporting and other news outlets of the ways, large and small, that the partial government shutdown is affecting Americans nationwide.

They're just not being paid.","The State Department, which had furloughed most of its diplomats, called them back to service starting next week and suggested it would somehow be \"taking steps to make additional funds available to pay employee salaries.\" They won't be paid for the time they've been furloughed until after the shutdown ends, according to a statement on State's website.","While State somehow found money to pay its workers, they'll join tens of thousands of IRS agents, thousands of FAA safety inspectors and hundreds of FDA safety inspectors who were also called back to work this week, joining the hundreds of thousands already reporting for duty for their government jobs each day but not getting paid.","Repeat: Hundreds of thousands of Americans will have worked the last two weeks and will get a $0.00 paycheck.","The Trump administration continues to scramble to blunt the effects of the shutdown, which President Donald Trump once said he would be proud to own.","Bringing services back online means Americans are getting most of the services of government, they're just not currently paying for them at the moment.","President Trump did sign legislation Wednesday that promises back pay for workers furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown. Others, like contractors who are not performing duties, could be left out.","With no end in sight and no serious talks with Democrats on Capitol Hill underway, the shutdown is bearing down on the month-long marker. That's multiple pay periods for people who are not rich. Those who aren't left on furlough, but rather working, can't collect unemployment. They can't find side jobs if they're doing their day jobs.","Shutdown is not a technical term but a political one. The federal bureaucracy and Congress prefer to call what we're seeing right now a \"lapse in government funding\" or a \"funding gap.\"","That doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as \"shutdown,\" but at this point it's probably more accurate given the administration appears to be not hemmed in by specific guidelines. When it appears the shutdown will inflict pain, they simply deem a new set of workers essential or find a new pot of money to keep an office open, as they did with a separate set of IRS workers who process income verification queries for mortgage companies, or Interior Department employees keeping a proposal for new oil drilling on schedule.","The $5.6 billion Trump wants for his wall and other border security efforts is but a small fraction of the money the impasse is holding up, which would be used to fund about a quarter of the government. The affected agencies include nine Cabinet agencies (Justice, Interior, Homeland Security, Labor, Agriculture, Transportation, State, Treasury and Commerce) along with smaller independent agencies from the FDA and EPA to the Smithsonian and NASA. Other key agencies like the Pentagon already have funding, and most of the social safety net, like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, gets its funding automatically.","It was only ever really a quarter of the government affected by the shutdown. And more than half of the affected workers from the start were expected to work without pay. That ratio has grown as the shutdown has carried on and more workers have been called back to the job.","Democratic administrations, which entered shutdowns in the 1990s and 2013, tried to drive home the pain of missing government services.","The opposite is true now, as the Trump administration reclassifies employees from furloughed to essential or excepted from furlough at will.","As CNN's Greg Wallace reported after a conversation with Alice Rivlin, who was OMB director during the Clinton administration, the administration has fairly wide latitude to determine what governmental functions are essential or can be suspended.","\"The law itself is pretty vague,\" Rivlin said. \"In the end it's a judgment call.\"","She said she believes the Trump administration is showing more concern about effects to the public at large than to federal workers.  ","So have the courts, for now. A federal judge rejected a lawsuit brought by air traffic controllers and other government employees citing the Antideficiency Act. Separate lawsuits are in the works, including one that cites the 13th Amendment, which is the Amendment that ended slavery and \"involuntary servitude.\"","There have been some good explainers, such as this one in The Washington Post, about the tension between the Anti-Deficiency Act, which requires the government not to spend money that hasn't been appropriated, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires the government to pay its workers.","All of this says nothing of the army of contractors -- from the low-paid janitor to the high-paid executive -- who subsist on federal contracts. Those people, particularly those with smaller paychecks who are least able to weather through a lapse in funds, are unlikely to see back pay if their contractor isn't currently paying them.","CoreCivic is a major contractor for the Justice Department that performs essential duties related to inmates and prisons and holds hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shutdowns, said they will continue to fulfill obligations, both to the government and their workers.","\"Our company is dedicated to supporting both our government partners and our staff during the shutdown,\" said Amanda Gilchrist, CoreCivic's director of public affairs in an email. But they expect to ultimately be paid and have continued to pay their workers. \"Our government partners have indicated that our contracts are considered essential government services, meaning we are to remain open, but that payment will be delayed until the government reopens.\" ","---"],"17":["(CNN) - As the government shutdown stretches towards a fifth week, FBI field offices across the country are opening food banks to help support special agents and staff struggling without pay.","In Dallas, Newark, New Jersey, and Washington, the FBI has set up or planned for areas where employees can drop off non-perishable food items for other employees to pick up, according to multiple law enforcement officials.","On the West Coast, at least two FBI field offices are considering establishing food banks as one of a number of ideas to help employees hurting from the shutdown, a law enforcement official said.","\"We're all in this together and we're banding together to help each other out in any way we can,\" said Melinda Urbina, a spokeswoman for the FBI field office in Dallas, where a volunteer employee group set up the food bank now filled with pastas and canned goods in one of the main break rooms.","Some 35,000 FBI employees, including administrative and support staff, missed a paycheck last week as negotiations between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over government funding and border security have stalled. ","That has left many also searching for outside employment, despite limitations on the type of work employees can do and still keep a security clearance or not violate government employment rules.","Justice Department component agencies have had a number of requests from employees, including law enforcement agents and officers, seeking guidance on outside employment, two senior law enforcement officials told CNN. Lawyers have been doing research to determine what type of outside employment would be allowed, the officials said.","RELATED: State Department orders staff back to work, says they will be paid","Another law enforcement official said that the number of requests for outside employment at one FBI field office has \"significantly increased.\" All FBI employees must get approval through an established process before they engage in other work.","Law enforcement officials have also warned that FBI investigations are being damaged as operational budgets dwindle.","Pay for informants and surveillance work as well as drug buys in trafficking operations are all endangered as resource shortages restrict the tools available to investigators, according to Tom O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association, which represents most of the bureau's active duty special agents.

That's the only way the federal government can make the payment since the program initially wasn't funded beyond January.","The US Department of Agriculture announced last week that it is using a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse. The shutdown began after funding ran out December 21. ","The change has left states racing to issue the February benefits -- which are expected to total $4.8 billion -- by January 20. Typically, states issue benefits over the course of a month, in part to make sure grocery stores have enough food and to provide them with a steady stream of customers. Households receive $245 a month, on average.","State officials are working closely with the federal agency to speed up payments, and all are expected to be able to comply, said Ann Flagg, director of the Collaborative Centers for Policy & Practice at the American Public Human Services Association, which represents state and local health and human service agencies.","\"It's certainly a compressed process with a high degree of urgency behind it,\" Flagg said, noting that some states have experience doing this because they have had to issue special disaster-related benefits to their residents.","Equally as important, however, is communicating to food stamp recipients that the money they are getting now is their February benefit, and they won't get more until March, at the earliest. At this point, the USDA doesn't have funding to guarantee food stamps will be issued in March if the budget impasse isn't resolved by then.","\"Families should be mindful of this when they are planning their shopping for the month and budget accordingly,\" said Jeanne Lambrew, acting commissioner of Maine's Department of Health and Human Services, which paid the benefits on Thursday.","States are contacting recipients in a variety of ways, including social media, mail, text messages and notices to grocery stores and community groups.","Florida, for instance, posted a message on Twitter alerting its 2.9 million residents in the program that they'll receive their benefits on January 20. ","Delaware is sending letters to each of its more than 136,000 households who receive help through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. It is also contacting senior centers, houses of worship, legislators and retailers.","Federal officials last week said that new applicants who are deemed eligible by January 31 can get a combined payment for both January and February, according to Flagg. However, those who are found to be eligible for February but do not receive a combined payment this month will only be able to receive benefits as long as federal funding remains. The USDA has a reserve of roughly $3 billion for the food stamp program.","---"],"19":["(CNN) - Perdue Foods is recalling 68,244 pounds of gluten-free chicken nuggets sold nationwide over fears of wood contamination, federal health officials say.","The ready-to-eat chicken nuggets were produced on Oct. 25, 2018, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Experts worry that the devices could put kids' developing brains at risk, get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs. But, the long-term effects aren't clear.","\"The FDA has concluded that the level of addiction it is seeing among youthful e-cigarette users is so disturbing and so unprecedented that it needs to at least ask whether we need a solution that goes beyond what we ever did with cigarettes,\" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, previously told CNN.","'Virtually no data' on treating kids who are hooked","Medical experts say there is an urgent need for research on using therapies to treat kids who are addicted to nicotine. Many health care providers are already using some off-label, such as nicotine gum, but without solid data on how well they work and how best to use them in conjunction with counseling and other resources.","According to experts, most of what we know about nicotine addiction in teens, we know from cigarettes. But the technology and chemistry of vaping might pose an entirely different threat.","\"These products deliver very high levels of nicotine, meaning that even brief experimentation is likely to put adolescents at risk for long-term dependence,\" Dr. Susanne Tanski, former chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium, told the FDA Friday.","\"Clinicians urgently require new solutions to safely and effectively help stop them using these and all tobacco products for good,\" said Tanski, also an associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. \"There is unfortunately virtually no data on how to treat an adolescent with e-cigarette dependence.\"","But some in attendance think the FDA should have focused the hearing on preventing kids from picking up vapes in the first place.","\"I believe\u00a0FDA posed the wrong questions for today's meeting,\" said Lauren Lempert, a law and policy specialist for the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.","Instead of debating the role of nicotine replacement and drug therapies, the agency \"should be focusing on policies that will prevent youth initiation with e-cigarettes and addiction to nicotine,\" Lempert told CNN in an e-mail ahead of the hearing.","In her statement to the FDA Friday, Tanski agreed.","\"Preventing youth use in the first place should be FDA's primary goal,\" she said. \"We must all recognize that if an adolescent has developed a nicotine addiction as a result of vaping, we've already failed.\"","Could regulation go further?","Lempert said the FDA has a number of effective regulatory tools in its arsenal: It can demand pre-market review of e-cigarettes and tobacco products. It can regulate marketing and prohibit unauthorized claims by e-cig companies about health, safety and smoking cessation. And it can ban all flavors.","Instead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold, the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.","At the hearing, Gottlieb said requiring e-cigarettes to go down such a regulatory path could be \"game-over for some of these products.\" If the prevalence of youth vaping continues to rise, that could prompt the agency to take more extreme action, he said.","In November, Gottlieb proposed strengthening the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products. These proposals could ultimately lead to their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors. But the proposed changes do not include mint, menthol and tobacco flavors. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes, \"but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine,\" he previously told CNN.","Flavors are at the center of the regulatory debate: Some say they're an imporant tool in getting adults to switch over from combustible cigarettes, while others want to ban them entirely because they appeal to kids and minimize how harmful and addictive vapes are perceived to be.","Mark Anton, executive director of industry group Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, told CNN that his group shares the goal of preventing kids from using vapes, but doesn't think flavors should be the target.","\"Flavors have been around for quite a long time,\" he told CNN ahead of his presentation at the hearing. \"You can't just attribute [the recent spike in youth use] to a flavor.\"","On the other side, health advocates say Gottlieb's November proposal, in exempting some flavors, did not go far enough.","\"There's no evidence that adults need these flavors to quit smoking,\" Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, founder and executive director of the Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, said at the hearing Friday. ","Halpern-Felsher's own research suggests that the majority of kids who have tried pod-based e-cigarettes started with one that was flavored.","\"All flavors need to be eliminated,\" she said.","---"],"22":["Washington  (CNN Business) - Americans are getting nervous.

What he knows less about is how to win.","As the former vice president nears a decision about entering the Democratic presidential race, his two failed bids for the White House remain a stinging reminder of a critical question confronting a potential candidacy: Can he win the big one?","While Biden is now celebrated by many Democrats as a beloved statesman after back-to-back victories with President Barack Obama, he has been far less successful carving his own path to the Oval Office. He not only lost his two previous races in 1988 and 2008, he fell profoundly short, with both campaigns highlighting some of his shortcomings.","Those defeats, spanning two decades of his time in the Senate, are bubbling just beneath the surface in discussions of Biden mounting a third bid for the presidency. He and his advisers insist those political wounds would ultimately make him a stronger candidate if he decides to take the step of trying to unseat President Donald Trump.","\"I am a gaffe machine, but my God what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can't tell the truth,\" Biden told an audience late last year. \"I'm ready to litigate all those things. The question is what kind of nation are we becoming? What are we going to do? Who are we?\"","Should Biden decide to join the ever-growing field of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, he would start in an unfamiliar place: as a front-runner. But even many admirers concede he's a front-runner in name only, with his advantage in early polls attributed to his high name recognition and his recent tenure as vice president.","The pole position could also be a curse, particularly in a party that famously loves to fall for a fresh face over a candidate with the longest resume.","Yet for all of those challenges, conversations with more than two dozen aides, donors and supporters, point to a consensus that Biden is still likely to run in what he repeatedly calls the most important presidential race of his lifetime. But until he gives the final nod, many caution he could also decide against it.   ","\"His thinking is centered around one thought: There has to be a new president,\" a top Democrat close to Biden said. \"That's what his campaign would be about.\"","Another ally who recently spoke to Biden said he was left the impression that the former vice president was closer to launching a bid than retreating to the sidelines. And his team is preparing a detailed campaign plan to be ready the moment he pulls the trigger, several people familiar with the matter say.","\"It was clear to me that he is at a point where he is certainly much more likely to announce a candidacy than announce he's not running -- although he did not give me that final decision,\" the ally said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.","Biden is aware that the moment he reveals his intention to run, this ally said, he would \"immediately become the target of not only the sitting president, but he'll in essence become the target of every other Democrat.\"","While he's reaching out to some close supporters, Biden has not had any recent, substantive discussions about his plans with Obama, two people familiar with the matter say. The former president plans to stay neutral in the race, although a Biden candidacy could complicate those intentions.","For Biden, one question that remains unresolved for he and his wife, Jill, is the unease some family members have about his potential candidacy. The family is still dealing with the aftermath of the 2015 death of their son, Beau, which is among the leading reasons Biden stepped away from running in 2016.","At his book tour event in Vermont last month, Biden said he wanted to honor a promise he made to his son to stay engaged in public life after his death, but he also said, \"I want to spend as much time as I can with my family.

Doug Jones, a friend of Biden, citing his strength appealing to blue collar workers. \"I think Joe's strength in the African American community and the Democratic base is very, very strong and much stronger than what people may give him credit for.\"","As they await Biden's decision, members of his inner circle have quietly worked to lay preliminary groundwork for a possible campaign, even without having the explicit assurance he will run. They've fielded calls and e-mails from interested staffers, held early conversations about campaign structure and reached out to donors. But there's only so much the team can do before getting the official go-ahead for a run from Biden.","\"The pieces are in place,\" a Democratic adviser familiar with the conversations said. \"People are ready to go.

Negative free cash flow accelerated to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, more than double the year before. ","It's not a onetime phenomenon. Netflix said on Thursday it expects to go through another $3 billion in 2019 to fund more content and splashy marketing aimed at luring in even more subscribers, especially overseas. ","Wall Street doesn't seem to mind. Netflix keeps rapidly adding customers and revenue continues to climb sharply. By spending gobs of money and borrowing aggressively, Netflix has built a formidable moat around its business that will make it harder for new and existing rivals to catch up. ","But Netflix can't burn that kind of cash forever, especially if market turbulence limits the ability of debt-laden companies to tap the junk bond market.","\"It's not sustainable,\" Neil Begley, Moody's senior vice president, told CNN Business. ","\"Strategically, Netflix is doing all the right things. But they've layered over that a level of financial risk that would make a lot of people uncomfortable,\" Begley added. ","Netflix expects cash burn to 'improve'","Investors seem unfazed. Netflix shares dropped 3% on Thursday, but they remain up 26% in 2019 through the first 13 days of trade.","Concerns about the balance sheet have been drowned out by rapid subscriber growth and Netflix's ability to jack up prices. The company announced a US price hike this week that demonstrated confidence in its business model.","And why wouldn't Netflix have confidence? It added a record 8.8 million paid subscribers during the fourth quarter, beating its own estimates. In total Netflix now has 139 million paying memberships, up from 110 million at the start of 2018. And the streaming company estimates it earns around 10% of television screen time in the United States.","Netflix signaled optimism on the cash burn front. While negative free cash flow will be \"similar\" this year to 2018, Netflix expects it to \"improve each year thereafter\" due to improving margins. Future investment will be funded more \"internally,\" Netflix said. ","Moody's agrees. Begley expects Netflix to break even on cash flows by about 2023. ","Streaming arms race","For now, analysts credit Netflix's hefty spending with sparking blockbuster growth, especially in international markets.","Goldman Sachs has found a strong correlation between how much Netflix spends on content and how fast it grows its subscriber base. ","Given that Netflix plans to continue to ramp up content spending going forward, Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry wrote in a report on Friday that there could be \"considerable upside\" to how fast the company adds customers in 2019. ","Netflix is in an arms race of sorts against rival streaming services owned by Amazon (AMZN), Hulu and Google's (GOOGL) YouTube. And the competition will only get more difficult going forward. Apple (AAPL), Disney (DIS) and CNN owner WarnerMedia all plan to launch streaming services of their own this year. ","UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said Netflix's latest results show the company has built a \"widening moat\" by building momentum on customer growth and finding blockbuster content success. He raised his price target on Netflix to $420, which is about 22% above current levels.","Leaning on debt","Netflix has leaned heavily on debt to fund that success. The streaming service's long-term debt has quadrupled since the end of 2015 to $10.4 billion. And Netflix is sitting on content liabilities (both current and non-current) of $8.5 billion.","\"All of this growth and investment in content has really been borne by bondholders,\" said Begley. \"And they plan to continue to do that.\"","It's been a winning strategy. Lured by Netflix's speedy growth, the junk bond market has afforded Netflix generous terms to borrow heavily. ","But that playbook could run into trouble if financial markets seize up, as they did at the end of last year. No US junk bonds were issued in December, the first such shutout of the junk bond market in a decade.","At a minimum, Netflix might have to accept higher borrowing costs during times of market stress.","The good news is that Netflix isn't facing any imminent debt maturities. The company doesn't have any debt due until February 2021, and even then it's a manageable $500 million, according to Moody's.","In the meantime, look for Netflix to continue to spend aggressively on content in a bid to pad its lead in the streaming wars.

","\"Unfortunately, this is something we should all be worried about, just as we have to worry about falls or bed sores,\" said elder abuse attorney Kirsten Fish. \"These recent examples are extreme cases, but we're realizing this is an underreported crime that happens a lot.\"","An exclusive 2017 CNN investigation found the federal government has cited more than 1,000 nursing homes for mishandling or failing to prevent alleged cases of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse at their facilities between 2013 and 2016. Nearly 100 of those facilities had been cited multiple times during the same three years.","That's likely just the tip of the iceberg. Experts say such abuse is not only under-reported and under-investigated, but often unnoticed or ignored.","\"If they have any sign of mental illness, dementia or Alzheimer's, they could say, 'I was raped by so and so' but nobody believes them,\" said Pat McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to improving long-term health care. ","According to the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, women and men with dementia are most likely to be victims. They say resident-to-resident sexual aggression is the most common form of abuse in nursing homes, but perpetrators can also be temporary and permanent staff, family, friends, even complete strangers visiting the facility. ","The 2017 CNN investigation also found most citations dealt with cases of residents abusing other residents. But the analysis also showed accusations made about aides, nurses and other staff members tended to be far more serious, involving allegations of forced intercourse, oral sex and other forms of sexual assault.","\"It's a crime of opportunity,\" Fish said. \"People who don't have friends or family to check on them at least monthly are most vulnerable to abuse. If there are staff shortages, which is common in the industry, there may be little supervision of the employees, especially at night.\"","Minnesota attorney Joel Smith, who specializes in representing those abused or injured in nursing homes, said it's not just one time of day or one caregiver, \"it's shift after shift.\" He recommends that families investigate the quality of the facility's management. ","\"How does the place smell? Do people seem to care? If your heart is tugged at when you walk down the halls there's a good chance it is not [the] right place,\" Smith said. \"The service you get on the front end reflects the quality of management behind the scenes.\"","Signs of sexual abuse","Experts say that families should be alert for signs of sexual abuse, even if the loved one doesn't -- or can't -- tell.","\"The body speaks even though the mind or mouth cannot,\" Smith said. ","Physical signs of abuse include bruising in genital areas, breasts and inner thighs, unexplained vaginal infections or bleeding, pain or irritation in the vaginal or anal areas, and torn, stained or bloodied underwear or linens. Also look for sudden or new difficulty walking or sitting, according to the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care.","Not all abuse is visible, but there are other, possibly subtle signs as well. An abused loved one might withdraw from social activities and interactions, or develop sudden fears of the dark, increased nightmares or disturbed sleep. They could react differently to their abuser and show fear or avoidance of that person or a singular place. Panic attacks, extreme agitation and other PTSD symptoms could suddenly appear or grow worse. Some might even attempt suicide.","Resources ","There is a national registry of Medicare funded nursing homes where you can find out how the facility ranks and if it has been cited in the last three years for sexual or other forms of abuse. Since few cases are reported, that may not tell you much. ","Experts suggest families ask about staff training, frequency of check-ins and whether all staff, volunteers and vendors have had criminal background checks.   ","But Smith, who has prosecuted a number of abuse cases in which employees or facilities covered up abuse, is skeptical.","\"If it's a bad facility, I don't have faith in the type of answers you will get,\" Smith said. \"I feel like the people who run the bad facilities get really good at rebuffing legitimate questions.\"","Be aware of your loved one's rights, said McGinnis. Any nursing home or facility that receives funds from Medicare or Medicaid, and nearly all do, fall under federal law.  The law says every 90 days every resident is supposed to get a medical exam, by a medical doctor or physician's assistant. ","\"In California, it's every 60 days for nursing homes,\" McGinnis said. \"And the state just recently applied that to assisted living facilities. You also have a right to see your loved one's medical chart, and you should take advantage of that.\"","McGinnis also tells any family with a loved one in a nursing home certified by Medicare or Medicaid to start a family council and start sharing their experiences. ","\"Federal law says that when two or more relatives of nursing home residents get together, the facility has got to give them a place to meet,\" she said. \"They've got to respond to the family council's recommendations or concerns within a certain time period. It's a very powerful tool.\"","Federal law clearly lays out the rights of residents and the responsibilities of the facility. If you feel those are not being met, reach out to your state's long-term care ombudsmen program [you can search by state online].  Funded by the government, the program provides advocates who can investigate complaints for residents in nursing homes, long-term care homes and assisted living facilities.","\"When requested by the family, the ombudsman has the right to enter the care facility and investigate,\" Smith said. \"While they can't arrest, they can go in and start waving shiny lights into dark places and hopefully uncover and solve problems.\"","Above all, if you are concerned about possible sexual abuse of your loved one, act. Call the ombudsman, call adult protective services, call local police and obtain immediate medical attention for your loved one.

","The study found that for every 1,000 people living in an area, opioid prescribing rates increased 182% and prescription opioid overdose deaths increased by 9%, for every $5.29 a pharmaceutical company spent on perks such as lunches and trips for doctors.","\"The prescribing was clearly very, very strongly associated with marketing,\" lead author Dr. Scott Hadland, a pediatrician and researcher at Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, said in an email.","Hadland and his colleagues compared marketing data from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments database between August 2013 and December 2015 with prescription drug overdose data from August 2014 to December 2016. During that time, they found that pharmaceutical companies made nearly 435,000 payments totaling $39.7 million. Those payments included transactions such as lunches, consulting fees, travel and honorariums for 67,507 physicians across the country. ","The researchers noted that the greatest influence on both opioid prescribing and number of overdose deaths wasn't the amount of marketing money spent on each doctor. Instead, it was the number of \"marketing interactions,\" what researchers call transactions that include free lunches, speaking fees and travel compensation. ","\"A typical lunch costs only $20 or less, and when doctors receive multiple lunches over time, this appears to have the greatest effect on changing doctors' prescribing,\" Hadland said.","The authors say the study is the first of its kind to make quantitative associations between how much pharmaceutical companies spent marketing opioids and their influence on the number of prescriptions and the number of fatal overdoses from prescription opioids. ","CNN has reached out to PhRMA, the pharmaceutical industry's trade group, for comment but did not receive a reply.","Where more opioid marketing dollars were spent","Since 1999, the number overdose deaths involving prescription opioids has increased five-fold. More Americans now die annually from drug overdoses than the number of American troops killed during the entire Vietnam War. ","In 2017, there were more than 70,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States. The leading contributor to these deaths are opioid drugs, which include both legal painkillers such as morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone, as well as illicit drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. ","Heroin and illegally manufactured fentanyl are the two drugs most commonly involved in overdose deaths in the US. In 2016, fentanyl was involved in 28.8% of deaths while heroin was involved in a quarter of all overdose deaths that year. Prescription opioids were still involved in at least 24% of overdose deaths in 2017.  ","The researchers found that most opioid marketing dollars that went to doctors were concentrated in counties in the Northeast, while the Midwest had the lowest amounts.

","In making the claim, Gauger told the paper he wasn't fully paid for the work, though the Journal said Cohen was reimbursed $50,000 -- the amount the two originally agreed on for Gauger's services -- by the Trump Organization. Gauger, according to the paper, also received a boxing glove \"worn by a Brazilian mixed-martial arts fighter\" along with the cash payment. ","The paper said that Cohen denied paying Gauger in cash, instead telling the Journal that \"all monies paid to Mr. Gauger were by check\" and declining to comment further. The Trump Organization did not comment to the Journal. Rudy Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, told the paper that the allegation that Cohen received more money than what he paid to Gauger shows he's a \"thief.\"","Later Thursday morning in a statement to CNN, Cohen said his actions were \"at the direction of and for the sole benefit of Donald J. Trump. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it.\"","CNN has reached out to the Trump Organization for response to Cohen's claim. An attorney for Gauger said they would not comment further on the Journal's story.","The Journal said that Cohen's reimbursement was made around the same time that he received a $130,000 reimbursement from Trump for expenses incurred during the 2016 election. CNN has previously reported that Cohen used the $130,000 as a hush money payment to a woman who allegedly had an affair with Trump, which Trump denies.","Gauger told the paper that Cohen asked him in early 2014 to help Trump score well in a CNBC online poll of business leaders and a 2015 Drudge Report poll of potential Republican candidates. Gauger's efforts for the CNBC poll were unsuccessful, according to the paper, and Trump ranked low in the Drudge Report poll. ","Cohen has publicly broken with Trump since cooperating with the Mueller investigation. He is expected to testify before the House Oversight Committee next month and is prepared to discuss topics related to hush money payments and aspects of the Trump Organization, including the roles of the President and his children, a source familiar with the matter has said.","---"],"37":["Editor's Note: Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book, \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,\" and co-author with Peter Eisner of \"The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's.

He was talking about the upcoming presidential election, and oh how right he was. The system and surrounding media coverage was being rigged, by Russians, and Macedonian trolls and now, we know, by the President's self-described \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen. ","Cohen, who will soon testify before Congress, is becoming the John Dean of this era of political scandal.  (Dean, you'll remember, was central to the downfall of the Nixon presidency.) The latest Cohen revelation, offered by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by Cohen to CNN, finds him handing a literal bag of cash to a tech wizard named John Gauger, chief information officer at Liberty University, which advertises itself as a wholesome Christian institution (and released a statement Thursday making clear it allows employees to engage in \"side work\").  Gauger's ostensible side hustle in this case for Cohen apparently involved rigging online polls to show Trump was favored by respondents to CNBC and Drudge Report polls. Cohen confirmed the story, saying, \"What I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of [Mr. Trump]. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn't deserve it.\"","Regret is a theme Cohen has sounded again and again as the facts of his work for Trump have been revealed in court documents and press reports. Much of his behavior over the past year, including pleading guilty to making hush-money payments to protect Trump from potential sex scandals, which Trump denies, can be seen as an effort at atonement. Cohen spent years acting as a bully and a shield for a boss he tried to emulate. This brought him to a point where he has become an object lesson in the perils of making a deal with a narcissistic devil whose fear of honest competition drove him to cheat. Trump's team is now trying to discredit Cohen as a liar, a cheat, a low-life. The obvious question in response: If that's true, why did Trump employ him for a decade?  ","The Journal scoop shows Cohen acting as the devil's apprentice as he tried to use the methods that he had employed for his boss to benefit himself. In 2016, according to the report, Cohen had Gauger create a Twitter account called @WomenForCohen, which declared Cohen: \"Strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense, business oriented and ready to make a difference!\" ","Cohen's qualifications for sex symbol status rest in the eye of the beholder. The effort to persuade the country -- and perhaps himself -- that he is a hunk was truly, and pathetically, Trumpian. ","Throughout his life, businessman Donald Trump offered himself to the world as a sex symbol, even as his physique succumbed to hamburgers and gravity and his hair required heroic measures to address obvious balding. The creepy sexual banter on the \"Howard Stern Show\" and the extra-long ties, which he reportedly believes make him look slender, are, instead, evidence of a man trying to cheat even Father Time. Poor Cohen was only trying to follow Trump's lead.    ","Seen as an emblem of Trump's effect on those around him, @WomenForCohen and the alleged poll manipulation are a perfect illustration of the boss' values and his long-established habits. Terrified of being revealed as a loser in any arena, Trump has always been preoccupied with puffing up his image. Inflated claims about his personal wealth and ventures like Trump University were typical examples of the ways Donald Trump tried to distort reality. As a private businessman and a master manipulator, he succeeded well enough to become the host of a TV show that revolved around the fiction that he was a giant in his industry.","What worked for Trump the promoter apparently became a main ingredient in his campaign as Cohen helped establish the myth of his popularity with cooked polls that presumably bolstered the false narratives about everything from immigration to the supposed crimes for which his opponent should be locked up.  Add the yeasty factor of Russian interference on Trump's behalf and you get an election so stained by corruption that it's hardly surprising its leader, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, stands convicted of a host of offenses and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation threatens to bring a constitutional crisis.  ","Emerging from the mire of what is left of Trumpworld, Michael Cohen is an unlikely truth teller. When he worked for Trump, Cohen did whatever he could to intimidate the boss' critics or opponents and to inflate his accomplishments. This makes him, in the words of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani \"a pathological liar.\" (This was after Giuliani called Cohen \"honest and honorable.\")  Cohen has been working at becoming honest and honorable ever since he came under investigation for campaign finance law violations. One could say this change of heart was a matter of convenience, but whatever the reason, it is in the public interest for the nation to learn what Cohen knows about a President who rose to power via the lifelong practice of deception and misdirection. ","In the past, Cohen's association with Trump made his statements easy to dismiss. Today it gives us reason to pay close attention.

Because that's not her record,\" Bazelon said. \"I think that the decisions she made had an eye toward running for higher office -- had an eye toward trying to walk this tightrope of not getting law enforcement and police and prosecutors upset with her.\"","Harris aides dismissed the piece as opinion and noted that a number of Bazelon's examples lacked proper context, or even an acknowledgment that line-level prosecutors made central decisions in a number of the most controversial cases.","\"Kamala Harris has spent her career fighting for reforms in the criminal justice system and pushing the envelope to keep everyone safer by bringing fairness and accountability,\" said Lily Adams, Harris' spokeswoman, said in a statement.","\"In 2004, when most prosecutors were using a tough on crime approach, Senator Harris was starting Back on Track in 2004 which diverted young people charged with first time drug offenses into apprenticeship and training programs instead of decades long prison sentences. When she was Attorney General, she brought accountability to the system with the first statewide training on implicit bias and procedural justice in the country, body cameras to the agents at DOJ, launched multiple pattern and practice investigations and demanded data on in-custody deaths and police shooting be made available to the public.\"","Citing the criticism of the fact that Harris did not take a position in 2014 on Proposition 47, a reform of California's three strikes law, Harris aides said her policy as attorney general was that she would not take a position on a ballot measure if she was responsible for writing the ballot language. She viewed it as a conflict of interest.","While Harris did favor reforming the three strikes law for low-level felonies to help reduce California's prison population, she also had concerns that if inmates were released there should be proper support services in place to help them. Aides noted that while Harris was district attorney and dealing with the three strikes law on a day-to-day basis, she did not seek any 25-year-to-life sentences on any low-level crime.","Bazelon also faulted Harris for refusing as attorney general to support statewide standards governing the use of body-worn cameras by police officers.","At that time, Harris, broadly, supported the use of body-worn cameras and required Department of Justice officers who she oversaw to wear them. But an aide said she believed that each police jurisdiction should have flexibility to set their own standards for how footage could be used, how long it should be kept and when it should be released to the public.","Bazelon's piece also criticized one of Harris' most controversial stances, which was her decision to defend the death penalty as California's attorney general even though she personally opposed it. Earlier in her career, Harris took considerable heat for refusing to seek the death penalty in 2004 for the killer of San Francisco police officer Isaac Espinoza. ","In part because of the complexity of Harris' record, Bazelon touched off a vigorous debate about Harris' criminal justice stances, both on Twitter and in early voting states like Iowa and South Carolina, where Harris is scheduled to visit next week.","If Harris runs, it is a debate that will likely play out for many months among her 2020 rivals, particularly as Harris tries to consolidate the African-American vote in South Carolina and the early states of the Southeast where that demographic makes up a large portion of the electorate.","The Democratic California senator, who has worked closely with Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on bail reform and co-sponsored legislation making lynching a federal crime, has clearly been expecting these attacks from the left, particularly as criminal justice reform became a focal point for Democratic activists.","In her new memoir and during her talks at book tour events, she frequently noted her family's surprise at her decision as a young woman to become part of a system that has disproportionately incarcerated black and brown men.","Harris writes in the book that she \"knew that there was an important role on the inside, sitting at the table where the decisions were being made. When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in.\"","At every event, she also noted her efforts to reduce recidivism, implicit bias within law enforcement and the program she launched giving first-time drug offenders an opportunity to get high school diplomas and jobs.","Some, noting the breadth and expanse of Harris' legal record over several decades, rose to her defense.","\"It is an unfortunate byproduct of the campaign season to place Democrats into a box,\" said South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Trav Robertson. \"I would believe that Senator Harris had significant input from her staff\u2014legal professionals in these circumstances. This opinion piece will have little impact on her chances in South Carolina.\"","\"Most important, her performance during the (Supreme Court Nominee Brett) Kavanaugh hearing and the (attorney general nominee William) Barr hearing more than likely will have motivated those who consider themselves progressives in the Democratic Party,\" Robertson said.","Bazelon's opinion piece in the Times also sent ripples through some Iowa Democratic circles as they await an announcement of Harris' decision.","Andrew Turner, the former campaign manager for Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand -- who narrowly beat the GOP incumbent in the 2018 race -- said the piece was \"widely talked about and passed around.\"","Turner acknowledged that most Iowans aren't making up their minds at this juncture, \"but activists and staffers do, and I think some who had liked her a lot before don't feel the same way.\"","He called the opinion piece \"troubling,\" especially to him, a young Democratic man of color.","\"This op-ed for me, helped narrow down my choices,\" Turner said to CNN. \"Senator Warren and Senator Booker both have tremendous records on these issues and don't need to explain why just as recently as 2014 they couldn't support a State Proposition (47) that would help curb some of the systemic racism in the criminal justice system and would improve the quality of life for so many young black and brown, men and women.\"","\"I think there's lots of other black and mixed race Democrats out there thinking the same thing I am right now,\" Turner said.","Former Iowa Democratic Party chair Sue Dvorsky called the review of Harris' record \"fair because she's expected to be top tier.\" Dvorsky noted that every one of the 2020 candidates is facing scrutiny of their records.","\"It isn't too early. We're starting,\" Dvorsky said. \"Every one of these candidates have three things they have to do: Lay out a positive vision of why them; explain how they are going to address the current occupant's style; and respond to their own record.

You barely noticed the captain's announcement about a half-hour ago that \"we'll be starting our descent into Vancouver in a few minutes,\" and that \"there are low clouds around the airport.\" ","Next thing you know, the plane thumps onto the runway and begins to slow down. Looking out the window, about all you can see is the glow of the white, runway edge lights zipping past, shrouded in thick cloud.","Just how did the pilots safely land in this pea-soup? ","They had high-tech help.","Hands-off flight","Based on the pilot's inputs, an autopilot calculates a path though the air, and it'll move an aircraft's control surfaces to fly straight and level, through turns, climbs and descents, or to follow a specific flight plan.","The control surfaces are moveable, aerodynamic devices on the plane's wings and tail that allow the pilot to control the flight attitude (the orientation of the plane in relation to the horizon). ","The first aircraft autopilots were developed more than a century ago by American Lawrence Sperry, which he demonstrated in France in 1914. ","In 1937, US Army Air Corps experiments in automatic landing systems resulted in the first successful autopilot-controlled landing. ","But the technology didn't mature until the 1960s when British European Airways (BEA) -- an ancestor of British Airways -- began flying automatic landings using the Hawker Siddeley HS-121 Trident short (and later medium-range) passenger jet. ","Driven by the often bad weather conditions across the UK and Europe, the Trident's ability to perform what was described as a \"blind landing\" allowed BEA to maintain its flight schedules.","Fifty years later, virtually every modern airliner from the smallest regional plane to the largest wide-body jet has autoland capability.","Follow the beams","When clouds surround an airport, pilots have been able to find the path to the runway for decades by using an Instrument Landing System, or ILS.","Ground-based transmitters project one radio beam straight down the middle of the runway, and another angled up from the runway threshold at a gentle three degrees. ","During an approach, a display on the aircraft's panel shows pilots whether the plane is to the left or right of the runway -- on the localizer beam -- and above or below the descent path, called the glideslope.","To complete a safe landing, pilots must be able to see the runway at a specific decision height (DH) above the ground. A minimum horizontal visibility is also specified, called the Runway Visual Range, or RVR. The RVR is measured on the ground, and the information given to the pilots before they begin an approach.","At DH, if the pilots can't see the runway environment -- which can include the runway's high-intensity approach lights -- the crew must climb away from the airport, and either try again or go to an airport with better weather.","Generally, the minimum altitude on an approach is at least 200 feet above the ground, depending on the airport's location and surrounding terrain. With additional equipment on board and a tightly calibrated ILS system, minimums can drop to 100 feet.","Zero-zero","ILS approaches are designated by category. CAT I has the highest minimums, CAT II is lower, and three levels of CAT III approaches drop the decision height to zero altitude and zero visibility -- a true autoland and rollout. ","The first aircraft certified to fly a zero-zero approach was the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, in the 1970s. That early wide-body was equipped with a Collins Aerospace autopilot, and the company continues to make sophisticated, advanced-tech systems for many airliners, including the Boeing 737MAX and upcoming 777X, and the Airbus A220.","But it isn't just about computers, explains Craig Peterson, senior director of commercial systems marketing for Collins Aerospace.","\"The flight crew involvement is key in the entire autoland operation. Not only does the airport facility and the aircraft need to be approved for autoland operations, the flight crew also needs to be trained and be approved to perform them. The autoland system is a high-integrity complex system due to the safety-critical nature, and the flight crew has to continually monitor the system operation and performance.\"","On a CAT III autoland approach, the pilots cross-check the plane's speed and path to the runway and are ready to take over from the computers, should a system fault occur.","To become highly proficient and certified to fly autoland operations, pilots endure intensive and sweat-inducing training sessions in ground-based simulators -- ones with ultra-realistic graphics displays, controls and cockpit movements that accurately duplicate the flight experience.","Sim sessions","\"The simulator is so accurate, and we can reproduce the worst weather conditions,\" explains John Mulder, chief pilot, flight technical operations for Calgary-based WestJet. \"It's the best place to train for CAT III approaches. In the simulator, we tend to go right to the limits and the capabilities of the aircraft.\" ","The Canadian airline has a large fleet of Boeing 737s, including the newest 737MAX, and will soon be flying the globe-spanning Boeing 787 Dreamliner.","WestJet's 737s are equipped to fly CAT III approaches down to a decision height of just 50 feet, the altitude at which the captain must quickly decide whether to let the plane land or to abort the approach.","\"There's a radar on the bottom of the aircraft that's measuring our distance to the ground. We'll be past the high-intensity runway lights, and at that point we're going to be over or past the runway threshold,\" said Mulder. \"We have to have the landing environment in sight or we'll go around.\"","Many airliners can fly full CAT III zero-zero approaches, with additional on-board computers and systems that automatically track the runway centerline after touchdown, apply the brakes, and bring the plane to a safe taxi speed.","Firm but fair","Pilots know that passengers will give high marks for a smooth landing, when it feels like the wheels have simply rolled onto the runway.","But in rainy or snowy weather, that isn't necessarily the best way to put the plane down, according to Mulder. \"We actually like to have a landing that's a little bit firmer to break the wheels through any kind of contaminants, to get them firmly on the ground so that braking can be effective.\"","That kind of touchdown is programmed into the autoland systems, even though passengers might feel like they've landed on an aircraft carrier instead of a runway.","So, who makes the more consistent landings, the pilot or the computer?","\"Well, to be honest, the firm landing is the better landing,\" said Mulder.

","Nearly a dozen former cartel associates have testified against Guzman at his federal trial in Brooklyn, New York, but Sanchez was the first female cooperating witness. Guzman has pleaded not guilty to charges of international drug trafficking and conspiracy to murder rivals.","Sanchez, in a blue prison uniform, testified Thursday as Guzman's wife, Emma Coronel, sat in the courtroom gallery. Sanchez said she met Guzman in 2010 when she was 21 years old. ","\"Until today I'm confused, I thought it was a relationship romantically, as partners,\" Sanchez said, eliciting laughter from Coronel. ","'His home wife' ","Even though Sanchez grew close to Guzman, when she would go visit him at his hideout in the mountains in Sinaloa, her eyes would be covered so she wouldn't know where she was being taken, and her phone was taken away. ","The phone was a central part of their life as a couple. Early in their relationship, Guzman had a worker bring her a BlackBerry \"that had been fixed so that we could communicate.\" At this point, Guzman had been on the run from authorities for nearly a decade after escaping from a Mexican prison in 2001.","Sanchez said the pair talked every day, at all hours of the day, and that Guzman would have someone bring her a new phone every few weeks. A former IT technician for Guzman testified last week that Guzman had him install spyware that would allow him to track phone calls and messages of close associates, lovers and family. ","At one point, Sanchez lived with Guzman at one of his safe houses. She would take care of personal errands for Guzman, who couldn't leave the house. ","\"I was his home wife,\" she said. ","She would buy his clothing: shirts, pants, shoes and underwear. And she would cut the pant legs, she said, because they were often too long. ","Guzman's nickname, after all, is \"El Chapo,\" which means \"shorty.\" ","The three B's of quality","Their relationship shifted when, in 2011, Guzman asked Sanchez if she knew anything about different types of marijuana. She didn't. So, he sent her to a mountainous region in her home state of Durango, where she had ties to a community that included marijuana farmers and producers."," \"He did not have anyone to get marijuana for him,\" she said. \"At least, that's what he would say.\"","It was difficult to get cell phone service in the remote region, Sanchez said, so she would climb a tall hill multiple times a day to be able to communicate with Guzman. Intercepted BlackBerry messages show Guzman instructing her to buy 400 kilos of marijuana to be loaded onto a private plane flown by a pilot who was his associate. ","Guzman told her, she testified, that when looking to purchase marijuana, she should look for \"the three B's of quality\" -- Buena (good) bonita (pretty) and barata (cheap)."," At first, Guzman wanted her to buy the marijuana on credit, but she pushed back because she worried the farmers wouldn't get paid."," \"Those were people who were very low-income people, and they worked way too much,\" she said."," In intercepted BlackBerry messages, Guzman texts her, \"love ... you have to rip the bags open so you don't buy anymore with seeds.\" Guzman was referencing marijuana with seeds, which is of poorer quality, Sanchez said. She said she would purposely send packages of marijuana with seeds \"because I wanted him to get upset with me so he would send me back.\""," Sanchez said Guzman never paid her for her work.","The naked escape","In 2014, Sanchez and Guzman had an on again, off again relationship.

","Meanwhile, US DEA agent Victor Vazquez was outside. Vazquez was based in Mexico City and tasked with trying to track down three men believed to be heads of the Sinaloa Cartel: Rafael Caro Quintero, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada and Guzman. After failing to capture Zambada, Vazquez was closing in on Guzman's safe house. ","He and the team of Mexican marines he had embedded with were banging on the door of the home, where Guzman and Sanchez were resting. The metal door was so strong that multiple marines attempted to take it down with different battering rams. ","Before the banging began, Guzman's associate ran into the bedroom, where Guzman was fast asleep. ","\"They're on us, they're on us,\" Guzman's associate, known as \"C\u00f3ndor,\" yelled, waking Guzman. ","The group ran to the adjoining bathroom, where Guzman had his signature hydraulic lift installed under the bathtub. With the press of a button, the bathtub lifted, revealing a dark, damp space. The group went inside, closing the tub above them, and they were in darkness. ","The area turned into a tunnel, and Guzman ran off ahead of the group, completely naked. ","Vazquez did not capture Guzman that day. But Guzman's 13-year stint evading authorities would come to an end just a few days later, until he escaped again in 2015. ","Sanchez, on the other hand, decided to run for office shortly after Guzman's arrest. Her term as a Sinaloa state legislator was cut short after three years, after she was stripped of her title and accused by the Mexican government of using false identification to visit Guzman in jail. ","Sanchez was arrested after trying to cross into the United States through a port of entry in San Diego in 2017, where she had been attempting to request political asylum. She was charged with drug trafficking conspiracy charges, pleaded guilty and entered a cooperation agreement with the US government. She faces between 10 years and life in prison.

Though the GOP majority leader eventually prevailed, 11 of his Republican colleagues stood on the Senate floor this week and voted to maintain sanctions on companies tied to Russian oligarch and President Vladimir Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, despite direct requests from the White House and McConnell. ","Trump's dangerously pro-Putin flirtation with leaving NATO has met almost universal opposition in the Senate chamber. The biggest sign, however, is the Senate's softening support of Trump's monthlong government shutdown.","McConnell is a wily, unflappable, and determined Senate leader, and Democrats who underestimate him do so at their constant political peril, which is why the nervous muttering inside the Senate GOP about the economic damage this ongoing shutdown is causing the nation -- to say nothing of the political cost it is causing the GOP -- is so notable. For once, the complaints and concerns aren't from the Democrats whom McConnell spanks on a regular basis. The worry is coming from the Senate GOP, especially from some of the 22 Republican Senators up for reelection in 2020. ","Unlike the class of senators who ran in 2018, when the GOP managed -- quel miracle! -- to gain seats in deep-red states like North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana, the 2020 landscape for GOP incumbent senators includes many in battleground states -- and in a presidential year. ","Like all incumbents, the Republicans up for re-election in 2020 don't want to meet the same fate 40 of their colleagues in the House experienced last year. They'd like to go into a re-election year with a strong economy and the sense that Washington is at least vaguely trying to do something more productive than engaging in political arson. For now, however, McConnell seems to be following then-House Speaker Paul Ryan's strategy of 2018: Tie the GOP to the mast, and stick with Trump at all costs. His caucus is nervous, and rightly so. ","Their pollsters are telling them how bad this looks. Their consultants are describing the ads their opponents will run against them in 2020. Their economic analysts are predicting grim results with each passing day. Even the White House is admitting the economy is suffering and the pain will get worse. Donald Trump's juvenile insistence that the taxpayers fund his ill-considered vanity wall on the US-Mexico border has left the government in shutdown and the GOP holding the bag.","Beyond the politics, many of the Republican members of the Senate seem to have a growing awareness of just how consequential and dangerous the shutdown has become for the American economy and the American people. Washington has spent the last two years with Stockholm syndrome Republicans either defending or explaining away Trump and Trumpism. Often, they found a pathway to shrug off his behavior and minimize the consequences of Trump's reckless and divisive leadership, but now the cracks are showing.","Donald Trump and Barack Obama both benefited from a decade of loose Federal Reserve monetary policy which unleashed a giant ocean of money flooding the capital markets in the wake of the 2008 economic crash. The Fed's slow wind-down of easy money was like the end of a raucous party, even with the sugar rush of the 2018 tax bill thrown in. The stimulative effect of the tax bill pumped up a few last months of market lift, but what may be a wildly overpriced stock market is testing the limits of optimism. ","Trump's reality-TV trade war is costing American farmers and manufacturers billions. The trade war, combined with the shutdown's immediate and long-term costs, makes the Senate GOP increasingly complicit in engineering an economic downturn, just in time for the 2020 election season.  ","The rules of economic and political gravity are kicking in. Federal workers are going unpaid. The ripple effects in the economy just from those lost wages are going to hit the economic statistics and the markets hard -- and soon. Government operations like the Coast Guard, air traffic control, and the Transportation Security Administration won't operate without pay forever. Even the President's beloved Border Patrol isn't being paid.","This President can't tweet his way out of an economic and governance disaster of his own making. No amount of \"this is fine\" coverage on his pet networks will refill the depleted bank accounts of 800,000 families. ","As much as some Americans -- particularly those in my party -- would like to fantasize that government isn't an essential player in the economy, they're wrong. As an economic conservative, I wish it wasn't quite so central, but the truth is a stubborn thing. ","Trump isn't merely holding some faceless bureaucrats hostage for his wall. This shutdown is part of a deliberate new politics of visible, performative cruelty, much like the Trump-Stephen Miller \"kids in cages\" show waged with immigrant children as the victims. The stories you're seeing on the news of government families working without pay and facing financial disaster are a feature, not a bug. ","Trump views his presidency through a bizarre Manichaean lens; he must win the daily media coverage war. All else is secondary to him, but the issues are very real to the American people and the nation's economy. ","We're locked now in a daily battle over a government that most people want reopened that is being held hostage for a wall that won't work and which a majority of Americans don't want. Someone is getting stuck with the bill for Trump's show, and that someone is going to be the Senate GOP unless it acts -- and acts soon -- to end the shutdown.","Republicans have become like compulsive gamblers, pulling the Trump lever over and over again at the worst political slot machine in history. The increasingly rare occasions they get an outcome they like -- a judge here and a regulatory fix there -- are offset by the unappealing combination of malice and ineptitude of a White House willing to burn the economy to the ground to satisfy this President's ego.","Mitch McConnell's political calculus is usually astute. The biggest question in Washington now is how many of his fellow Republican senators he's willing to sacrifice on the altar of Donald Trump's ego.","---"],"50":["Hong Kong  (CNN Business) - Jailed auto executive Carlos Ghosn is facing a new round of allegations of financial misconduct.","Nissan (NSANY) and Mitsubishi Motors (MMTOF) said Friday that Ghosn, their former chairman, improperly received \u20ac7.8 million ($8.9 million) in compensation and other payments from a joint venture between the two carmakers.

The prince was \"obviously shaken,\" an eyewitness told the BBC, but he was able to stand and showed concern for the occupants of the other car. The female driver of the other vehicle and her passenger suffered minor injuries, and there was also a baby in that car who wasn't hurt.","It's unlike Philip to obsess about media coverage of his life but if he does tune in, he will probably feel a mixture of bafflement and despair about the focus on him after this crash. ","Despite his clear sense of duty to Queen and country, he's never had much time for royal protocol, as his long history of unapologetic public gaffes demonstrates. ","The Duke of Edinburgh is also famously independent and has been caught on several occasions getting frustrated by the strictures of his public role, asking photographers to \"get on with it\" and ignoring the instructions of aides.","The quid pro quo for being a member of one of the world's most famous families are the many trappings that come with it -- from historic castles to all-expenses paid hospitality and a fleet of luxury cars, complete with chauffeurs.

","Kim arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport Thursday evening, bringing with him a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meant for Trump, a source familiar with the denuclearization talks between the US and North Korea told CNN.","Lead negotiator Kim was spotted leaving the airport with US Special Representative to North Korea Steve Biegun and Pak Chol, a North Korean official who chairs the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee.","Amid signs the two sides are close to agreeing to a second summit the newly unveiled Missile Defense Review, which Trump personally introduced at the Pentagon, explicitly states that North Korea remains an \"extraordinary threat\" to the US, an assessment that is consistent with previous findings by US military and intelligence agencies but rarely acknowledged by Trump himself. ","Seven months ago, Trump declared that his first summit with  Kim Jong Un in Singapore had eliminated any nuclear threat posed by the North Korea even though the meeting produced no verifiable proof that the rogue regime will discontinue its nuclear program.","\"Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,\" Trump tweeted as he arrived back in Washington at the time. \"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\"","Since that time Trump has insisted that talks with North Korea are yielding progress, pointing to the lack of missile and nuclear tests as evidence that Pyongyang is moving towards denuclearization. ","Waiting for concrete steps","But Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that the US is still waiting on North Korea to take concrete steps to denuclearize, and the missile defense strategy released Thursday indicates that Pyongyang currently poses a significant threat to the US despite ongoing negotiations. ","\"While a possible new avenue to peace now exists with North Korea, it continues to pose an extraordinary threat and the United States must remain vigilant,\" the Pentagon assessment says. ","\"Over the past decade, it has invested considerable resources in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and undertaken extensive nuclear and missile testing in order to realize the capability to threaten the US homeland with missile attack. As a result, North Korea has neared the time when it could credibly do so,\" it says. ","Trump made little mention of North Korea in his public remarks at the Pentagon Thursday but the underlying missile defense strategy emphasizes efforts to improve protection measures against the existing North Korean arsenal.","\"The review reflects the fact that the Pentagon still views North Korea as a nuclear threat and states that the United States will enhance its missile defense capabilities to defeat a North Korean missile attack,\" according to Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.","\"The review states that North Korea has yet to achieve the capability to credibly threaten the US homeland. North Korea has not conducted enough tests to establish confidence in a reliable, working missile. But we have to assume that North Korea has a nuclear-armed ICBM that could strike the United States,\" he said. ","\"Even if the missile only have a 50% chance of hitting a major US city, that's enough to establish a modicum of deterrence,\" Reif added. ","Prior to Thursday's roll out of the Missile Defense Review, a senior administration official was asked specifically whether North Korea still poses a nuclear threat as Trump has previously suggested it does not.","\"The review does look at the comprehensive environment that the United States faces and our allies and partners face and it does posture forces to be prepared for the capabilities that currently exist and that anticipate in the future,\" the official said.","Fresh skepticism","The Pentagon assessment has injected fresh skepticism into an already fragile diplomatic process as Kim Yong Chol, Pyongyang's former spymaster who has served as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's counterpart in talks with the United States, arrived in the US capital. ","Kim is expected to meet Pompeo and US special representative to North Korea Steve Biegun on Friday, according to two US sources familiar with the negotiations..","It's unclear if he will visit the White House, but the sources say that is the expectation from the North Koreans and the US side is preparing for the possibility.","But his trip to Washington is viewed by some as a sign that the sides are getting closer to reaching an agreement regarding a second Trump-Kim Jong Un summit. ","Kim Yong Chol last came to the United States in June. He visited New York and met with Pompeo before traveling to Washington, where he delivered an oversized envelope containing a letter from Kim Jong Un to Trump in the Oval Office. The two met for two hours in the White House.","During that visit, Kim Yong Chol was able to break the impasse between Washington and Pyongyang and help get the first US-North Korea summit back on track.","Trump and Kim Jong Un's summit in Singapore in June ended with a commitment from Kim Jong Un to \"work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" but negotiations appear to have stalled since then.","No missile tests in 2018","North Korea refrained from carrying out any nuclear or missile tests in 2018 and has taken symbolic steps toward denuclearization, such as shuttering a missile test facility and destroying parts of its nuclear test site, Punggye-ri.","However, some argue that Thursday's Pentagon assessment indicates the US will need to do more than shore up its missile defense in addressing the threat posed by North Korea.","\"While there has been a yearlong pause in North Korean missile testing, Pyongyang's retention of its missile arsenal capable of striking at US forces in Asia and even threatening the US homeland indicates that its going to take more than just missile defense to change the equation with the Kim regime,\" said Behnam Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ","\"Missile defense has a role to play as part of a comprehensive effort to counter the North Korean threat but it's a limited one and its capabilities are often vastly overstated. We and our allies cannot missile defense our way out of vulnerability to North Korea's nuclear missiles,\" Reif said.","Many critics accuse the Trump administration of failing to get Pyongyang to agree to specifics at their first summit. They say the North Koreans are holding out for a second summit because they believe they can extract greater concessions by meeting with Trump directly, as opposed to working with envoys like Pompeo or Biegun.","\"Pyongyang is clearly dissatisfied with what it has been hearing from Secretary Pompeo and other senior US officials and is eager to go over the heads of the President's aides in order to engage directly with President Trump,\" Evans Revere, a former US principal deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, wrote in a paper presented in Seoul on Wednesday.","\"The current impasse in denuclearization talks is the product of a US demand that North Korea take specific denuclearization steps, together with the DPRK's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) insistence that the Singapore agreement is about improving relations and removing the US threat.\"","---"],"54":["New York  (CNN) - President Donald Trump has been painted into a corner \u2014 and not by his political adversaries, but by his own allies in conservative media. ","Right-wing personalities and media organizations have given Trump little, if any, room to negotiate his way out of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history -- which they prodded him into.","Figures like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Ann Coulter have demanded Trump keep the government shut down until Democrats provide him funding for a wall on the southern border. No wall, no deal.","Trump knows that, if he wants to maintain the support of his base, he cannot ignore these voices. ","He can weather critical stories from outlets like The New York Times or Washington Post because his most avid supporters do not trust mainstream news organizations or get their information from such places.","But the people in his base watch and trust the Fox News prime time lineup; they listen to talk radio hosts like Limbaugh, and they read websites like the Drudge Report.","If Trump were to back away from his demands for a wall on the southern border, he would almost certainly face sharp criticism from these outlets and figures. ","In mid-December, when he nearly signed legislation that would have funded the government, but provided no additional border wall funding, right-wing media outlets and personalities were furious. Breitbart called it a \"cave.\" The Drudge Report said Trump was in \"RETREAT.\" Limbaugh said he was going to \"get less than nothing.\" And Coulter excoriated him on her Twitter feed. ","Trump became sensitive to the criticism that he was backing off his promise to build a wall, people familiar with the matter told CNN at the time. Then, abruptly, he said he would not approve the short-term funding measure, leading to the government shutdown, which is now in its 27th day.","Now, Trump has little wiggle room to negotiate. ","If he retreats on his demands for a wall, he'll face the same criticism he received from right-wing media voices back in December -- and he'll once again be confronted with the possibility he could lose standing with his base. (Trump has already shed some support from his core constituency of whites without college degrees during the shutdown, but this could accelerate that trend.)","In other words, Trump has effectively been boxed in by his biggest supporters. ","Coulter, the conservative author who has been critical of Trump for his failure to thus far erect a barrier on the border, effectively made a similar point during an interview with \"Vice News Tonight\" this week. ","\"It is self preservation,\" Coulter said, \"because he is dead in the water if he doesn't build that wall. Dead, dead, dead.\"","The topic has even come up on Fox News. ","On Wednesday night, liberal Fox News commentator Juan Williams said on the air, \"You should go listen to Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, because they're running this government. And they have forced this president into a trap.\" ","Thus far, the right-wing media universe has backed Trump's fight with Democrats. They've urged him to leave the government shut down until Democrats provide him funding for a wall. ","\"Trump is assuring everyone he's not gonna cave on this, and I hope he doesn't,\" Limbaugh said on his program earlier this week. \"[W]e don't get opportunities like this one presents, and I just -- hope he sticks to it.\" ","---"],"55":["(CNN) - If the government shutdown lasts much longer, President Donald Trump's only way out may involve a choice between two pillars of his political viability -- his border wall and his purring economy.","More and more Americans are feeling the effects of the partial shutdown every day, from travelers stuck in security lines to Coast Guard officers now joining the hundreds of thousands of federal employees going without pay.","Yet the normal political pressure points that usually end shutdown standoffs are not working, perhaps because of the unique dynamics of the Trump era. As a result, there's every chance that the stalemate now in its 27th day could drag on much longer.","Trump told supporters on Tuesday, for example, \"We're going to stay out for a long time if we have to.\"","Sen. John Kennedy, who flew on Air Force One with the President on Monday, said Trump is adamant that he's not budging.","\"He is a carnivore -- and on this one he believes he is right,\" the Louisiana Republican said. ","In another sign the impasse could be extended, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the President to move the day of the State of the Union address -- now set for January 29 -- or deliver it in writing because of overstretched security agencies. A White House official familiar with preparations told CNN's Jim Acosta Wednesday night that, \"at this point,\" Trump still plans to deliver the speech as scheduled on January 29.","Shutdowns usually end when either side, the President or Congress, begins to feel unbearable pressure and the cost of going on outweighs the political damage sustained by a climbdown.","Since that pivot point is not yet at hand, longer-term factors may come into play. One significant pressure point could be the side effects of the shutdown on economic growth, unemployment and consumer confidence.","If the standoff over the President's demand that Democrats provide $5.7 billion in wall funding is prolonged, the chances of genuine damage to the economy -- one of the unarguable hot spots of Trump's presidency -- rise significantly. ","Kevin Hassett, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has warned that the impact of the shutdown on government contractors is higher than expected and could significantly shave growth figures.","\"We subsequently, right now, think that it's about a tenth of a percent a week, not a tenth of a percent every two weeks,\" Hassett told reporters on Tuesday.","His comment was intended to pile pressure on Democrats on Capitol Hill to give in to Trump's demands. But it also served to underline the risk to the President, who arguably has more at stake over the economy than Democrats.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday called the shutdown a \"self-inflicted wound\" and \"negative\" for the economy.","Trump rarely misses a chance to celebrate historically low unemployment numbers and strong growth figures. Good economic indicators will be crucial to his hopes of re-election and could blunt Democratic attacks next year as he seeks to retain Midwestern industrial states that paved his way to the White House.","So if the economic damage from the shutdown starts to add up, it could begin to weigh much more heavily on Trump's political calculations.","Economy is 'incredibly strong'","White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders tried Wednesday to squash a growing narrative that the shutdown could put a dent in the Trump economy.","\"We are focused on the long-term economic goals of the administration,\" Sanders said. \"We have an incredibly strong economy, thanks to the President. We look forward to reopening the government, continuing to build on what we've done the last two years.\"","An economic headache could prove to be one way Trump begins to feel political heat over the shutdown, especially if it starts to reverberate in the stock markets, which have steadied after a volatile period at the turn of the year.","But if the economy tempts him to cave, it will be a difficult choice, since the shutdown may be the last best chance to get funding for the wall during his term. While he could vow to continue the fight for the border wall in his re-election race, his promises could be devalued if he is defeated by Democrats this time around.","So far, the President has not seemed to be moved by the traditional leverage points that occur during shutdowns.","He's not showed much sympathy for government workers forced to go without pay, even suggesting that they want him to stand firm and get his wall.","And since he's not made much effort to broaden his political coalition in office, he has few middle-of-the-road voters to lose from digging into a showdown that pleases his base.","Democratic leaders are trying to change the equation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday invoked the plight of a government worker who missed a paycheck last week and is uncertain he can afford medicines.","\"I want President Trump to look into these faces and see what he is doing by using these men and women as pawns, using them in an extortion game,\" the New York Democrat said.","\"Mr. President, President Trump, look at the pain and suffering you're causing,\" Schumer said.","But Trump has so far proven impervious to such appeals. A President who has always had a strong connection with the people who sent him to the White House is calculating he still has some breathing room.","Polling polarization over the wall","New polling on Wednesday showed the price the President could pay if if he were to cave in on the wall, a fundamental campaign promise that is one of the keys to his bond with grass-roots supporters.","A Pew Research poll found that 79% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents see the shutdown as a \"very serious\" problem for the country, but just 35% of Republicans and Republican leaners feel the same way.","And emphasizing why neither party thinks it's in a political position that could prompt a compromise, 82% of Republicans and Republican leaners back a substantial expansion of the border wall. Only 6% of Democrats agree.","Democrats are indeed in a strong political position. Pelosi is at the apex of her power as speaker just months after the Democratic midterm election triumph. She has also been able to deflect Trump's blame over the stalemate by passing bills to open individual agencies -- that have gone nowhere in the Senate.","In a letter to the President on Wednesday she pulled off a true power play, saying that owing to security concerns amid the shutdown, he should reconsider the date for his State of the Union address.","Since the chance to address a joint session of Congress in an annual television ritual is the kind of high-profile event Trump loves, Pelosi gave the President little choice.","In effect, Pelosi was sending Trump a reminder of her power, and a message that if he wants to get his live State of the Union address, he will have to drop his demands and reopen the government.","Trump tried his own power move, inviting a group of moderate Democrats to the White House as part of a bipartisan group of moderates, seeking to peel them away from Pelosi.","But one of the lawmakers, Rep Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, told CNN's Manu Raju that he stressed the core Democratic position to the President.","\"It's very hard to actually find an agreement on a way forward on these other issues that are pressing without actually reopening the government,\" Gottheimer said.","His comments were a fresh sign that the internal political forces in Washington that could break open the stalemate are not yet in place, meaning it could take a significant nudge from outside -- perhaps a slowing economy -- to break the deadlock.","---"],"56":["Washington  (CNN) - Donald Trump, petulant and impetuous, never lets a slight go unanswered.

","While Border Patrol officials have discovered sophisticated tunnels used to move people or drugs under existing border fencing, one US official familiar with the incident said the migrants involved in Monday's crossing had simply dug a hole under the border fence and slipped underneath. A Customs and Border Protection official confirmed that \"a large group\" of migrants \"breached the border wall.\"","\"They dug under the fence,\" said Judd. \"Unlike most areas along the border, Yuma has some very sandy areas that is easy to dig in.\" ","The migrants were taken into custody about 10 miles east of the San Luis Port of Entry, along a stretch of the US-Mexico border lined with older fencing -- steel panels welded onto posts that previously served as vehicle barriers, with little foundation to speak of.","Some fencing in the Yuma area is expected to be replaced with new fencing paid for with funds appropriated by Congress last year. CBP has not confirmed exactly where the new fencing will be placed.","In November, a group of around 80 migrants from Guatemala -- primarily families -- were apprehended by Border Patrol after climbing over the legacy landing mat border wall east of the San Luis Port of Entry. Hours later, another group of around 80 people entered the United States by digging a shallow hole underneath the same portion of wall, according to CBP.

Boyd, an experienced supervisor albeit in a different industry, was given a clipboard and told to start.","But if he wondered if he was making too much of that, the situation crystallized when some of his juniors ignored him, refused to follow his directions and called him the N-word, though he could never see exactly who said it.","When he reported the insubordination to upper management, he said he was told to deal with it himself, to counsel his workers who'd used the slur. ","The message he said he took from his leaders at the plant: Be happy you're here. Deal with it.","But it got harder each day to ignore, he told CNN in an interview.","A white employee Boyd oversaw told him: \"Back in the day, you would have been buried with a shovel.\"","In his role as supervisor, Boyd reported that, too. The worker was taken to a disciplinary hearing with a union official and business leader where he freely admitted what he had said, Boyd recalled. But then Boyd himself was pulled aside and advised to let the matter go if he wanted to get along at the plant, he said. No disciplinary action was taken, Boyd said.","Boyd and other workers of color learned there was a coded language to talk about them, according to the lawsuit. White employees kept calling them \"Dan.\" They thought some people didn't respect them enough to learn their names. But other colleagues told them it was a slur, an acronym for \"dumb ass nigger.\" ","The N-word was a regular part of life at Toledo Powertrain, where components are made for various Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, Boyd said. A white woman seen walking with him later found \"Nigger lover\" written on her pizza box.","When Boyd and others reported the abuse, their leadership told them to handle it themselves, he said.","Even more violent situations were brushed away. Boyd said he feared for his life when a member of his team, irate about a vacation request, yelled and raised a heavy, metal clutch assembly as if he was going hit him.","Boyd said he reported it. This time the offender was punished by losing one day's salary. \"One day!\" Boyd repeated, frustrated. For what felt like a direct threat to his life. One swing with that clutch could have been deadly, Boyd said. He said he believes there's a simple reason why.","\"You have management people in high places, and union officials in high places, that work together to protect people ... that are white,\" Boyd said. ","'Like being at war'","It got to the point where Boyd began asking God to protect him.","\"I used to have to pray. Literally, 'Lord protect me,'\" Boyd said.  ","\"It was like being at war,\" he added.","He said he and another black supervisor, Derrick Brooks, who was a former Marine, treated their workplace almost like it was a battlefield. When they saw each other or checked in by phone, as they did every day, they would let the other know, \"I got your six,\" the term soldiers use to say they have your back.","It was the kind of reassurance they felt they were not getting from GM management.","And then Brooks found a noose hanging in the area where he worked. As the only black employee in that space on his shift, he believed it was aimed to intimidate him.","It was a breaking point, the beginning of the end of his career -- and that of Boyd -- at GM. Not just because the noose had been hung. But because of how GM allegedly reacted.","GM: Every shift was trained","That first noose, and then a second, then third, fourth and fifth were all reported to GM, according to the lawsuit Boyd and eight other black employees have filed against the company for allowing an \"underlying atmosphere of violent racial hate and bullying.\"","GM rejects that characterization.","The company declined to be interviewed but provided a statement that it held mandatory meetings and  closed the plant for a day to have training for every shift. ","\"Every day, everyone at General Motors is expected to uphold a set of values that are integral to the fabric of our culture,\" GM said in the statement. \"Discrimination and harassment are not acceptable and [are] in stark contrast to how we expect people to show up at work.\"","It continued: \"We treat any reported incident with sensitivity and urgency, and are committed to providing an environment that is safe, open and inclusive. General Motors is taking this matter seriously and addressing it through the appropriate court process.\"","Boyd, Brooks and other black workers said initial meetings after the noose focused on violence, but not racial discrimination or intimidation.","GM, which declined to answer questions on the record after supplying the statement, placed an article about harassment in the employee magazine. The company replaced all ropes in the plant with yellow chains in an effort to stem the noose incidents.","But Boyd, Brooks and other black workers say that just removed an object, not the hatred. ","The union at the plant also disagreed that any practices were discriminatory.  ","Dennis Earl, who was elected UAW local president in 2017, said: \"Union people protect employees no matter what race, ethnicity.\"","Of Boyd's allegations, he said: \"Punishments were equal across the board. If he feels management was being more lenient -- I don't see that. I've never seen that. It's pretty colorblind, if you ask me.\"","Earl, who is white, has worked for the plant for 34 years. He told CNN there could be \"bad actors\" like there can be anywhere, but there was no widespread intentional racism.  ","\"Do I believe people are a little too sensitive these days? Absolutely,\" he said.  \"What passed 20 years ago doesn't pass today.\" ","\"You can't say the things you used to say off the cuff. It doesn't excuse it, but it's not racially motivated statements,\" he added. ","\"It's just bad judgment.\"","Great salary, but too high a cost","Brooks and Boyd both wanted to keep their supervisor jobs. They had worked hard to get these jobs, very good jobs with a six-figure salary, far higher than most in Toledo.","Brooks used his salary for his eight children and Boyd takes care of his mother, a double amputee.","Both felt they had an extra requirement to draw their paycheck, beyond the work they did -- be grateful, do not complain. \"There's unwritten rules with regards to manufacturing plants and when it comes to management,\" Brooks said. \"When it comes to us being black supervisors, you need to be more appreciative of the job title that you have and go along and do the job that we're asking you.\"","But the noose felt like a direct threat.   ","\"How rough and tough can you be when you got 11 to 12 people who want to put a noose around your neck and hang you 'til you're dead?\" Brooks asked.","As with Boyd's experiences, Brooks was told to investigate the incident himself, he said. One person told him in a blatant lie: \"That's not a noose used for hanging, it's a noose maintenance operators use to tie off a line.\"","Brooks shook his head as he recalled the scene. \"Being in the military I know plenty about knots,\" he said, \"and I know there is no reason whatsoever to tie a knot like that other than to use it for hanging a person.\"","For Boyd, the noose was a threat filled with deeply racist roots, capping the fear he felt each of the previous shifts over 14 months in a workplace where he says racism was often ignored and allowed to thrive. \"A noose just represented everything that happened to me every day before that.\"","And then two colleagues said they had heard alarming rumors and advised Boyd to get a gun, he said.","\"There were eight white males that was supposedly plotting to sabotage and to follow me out,\" Boyd said.  ","It got to the point he was terrified. He feared that he'd be on the news after being found dead after an incident at the plant.","His mother urged him to quit the job, however much it paid. He left. So did Brooks.","Not just two men","It wasn't just Boyd and Brooks complaining. Another employee made a police report about the nooses and conversations about guns being brought to work. Others filed complaints with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.","The commission, which enforces state laws against discrimination, announced the findings of a nine-month investigation last March: GM did allow a racially hostile environment.","Darlene Sweeney-Newbern, the commission's director of regional operations, said racist behavior was so prevalent at Toledo Powertrain that she'd rank it among the worst cases her team has seen. Incidents continued while the commission was investigating, according to Sweeney-Newbern.","And she rejected GM's defense that it had taken appropriate action.","\"GM did not deny that these things were taking place. They simply said, 'Hey as soon as we heard of these things we moved in and we took action.' That is not what we found in the investigation,\" she said.","One example came from a former union president's testimony, Sweeney-Newbern said, that at a meeting to address the placing of nooses a white supervisor bemoaned that \"too big of a deal\" was being made.","That supervisor went on to say, \"There was never a black person who was lynched that didn't deserve it.\"","\"That shows part of the culture problem at the plant,\" Sweeney-Newbern said.","\"This is the individual that's going to go back and explain how wrong it is to the staff?\" she exclaimed.","With no hope of change at the plant, Brooks took another job that paid a lot less. He is working on his Ph.D. Boyd is back in school with plans to go into a different industry.","Both say they can't believe that in this day and age they experienced the racism they did at work for one of the United States' oldest and most storied companies, still a key part of the economy at No. 10 on the Fortune 500 list.","And they hear it's continuing  at the plant, which is why, they said, as part of their lawsuit they want the court to dictate procedures and policies to address incidents of harassment, as well as compensation for their suffering.","\"There hasn't been anything put in place with regards to trying to deal with the issue,\" Brooks said. \"They are not doing anything with regards to really getting into the crux of what the issue is.\"","GM has not identified who was responsible for hanging the nooses so no one has been fired for those incidents. However, a GM representative said there have been some people dismissed in Toledo during the entire process of extensive anti-discrimination, anti-harassment work, which is continuing across its plants with cooperation from the union.","Lawyers for the men suing GM say there continue to be hateful and racist remarks at the plant to this day, which they plan to include in the lawsuit. ","On Wednesday, lawyers showed photos including one showing a message scrawled on a cart on the plant floor that says: \"You only need to hang mean bastards, but mean bastards you need to hang.\"","GM said it is aware of the incidents and has retained a handwriting expert to analyze the graffiti, noting that the police are involved.","---"],"60":["(CNN) - Netflix is quickly approaching 150 million subscribers.","Netflix (NFLX) said Thursday that it added nearly 9 million new paying subscribers during the final three months of 2018, beating its own expectations of 7.6 million new subscribers.","The service now has 139 million subscribers globally. It expects to add another 8.9 million subscribers in the quarter that ends in March, the vast majority of which are expected to come from strong growth in its international markets. ","Expectations were high for the company heading into the holiday quarter report. The stock had soared roughly 50% from its low hit in late December amid a broader market sell-off.","Netflix stock was down about 3% in after hours trading Thursday following the report.","The earnings report comes at the start of what could be a pivotal year for the company. Two days before releasing the fourth quarter earnings report, Netflix unveiled plans to raise its monthly subscriber prices in the U.S. by $1-$2 per month, depending on the membership plan.","In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Netflix said it expects the price hike to be \"phased in\" for existing customers in the first two quarters of 2019. The pricing change takes effect immediately for new customers.","The price increase could help Netflix foot the bill for its staggering spending spree on content. Netflix previously said it expected to spend $8 billion on programming in 2018, up from an estimated $6 billion the year before. ","In an analyst interview that was posted after the earnings report Thursday, Netflix's Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations Spencer Wang did not explicitly state a content budget for 2019, but signaled that there will be \"higher content spend\" going forward. ","But this latest price hike comes at a time when the streaming market is about to get even more crowded. A host of deep-pocketed competitors are expected to launch streaming services this year, including Apple, Disney and WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN. That's in addition to rival services on the market from Amazon, Hulu and Google's YouTube.","\"The latest price increase may slow domestic subscriber growth dramatically this year,\" Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush, wrote in an investor note Tuesday. He noted that streaming options from Amazon and Hulu are now slightly more affordable than Netflix. ","Netflix's growth in the U.S has slowed considerably in recent years as it has saturated the market. Of the 8.8 million paying global subscribers added in the holiday quarter, just 1.5 million were domestic.","But there may still be room to grow. \"In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time and less than that of mobile screen time,\" the company said in its letter to shareholders. Its focus is on growing usage by improving the overall viewing experience for customers. ","\"Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members,\" the company said, referencing the name of Disney's new streaming service that is scheduled for launch this year. ","\"I think about it really as us winning time away, entertainment time, from other activities,\" Reed Hastings, Netflix's CEO, said in the interview. \"Instead of doing Xbox or Fortnite or YouTube or HBO or a long list, we want to win and provide a better experience.\"","The key to that effort is Netflix's years-long and costly bet on original programming. And on Thursday, Netflix did something unusual for the company: it released viewership numbers for several of its TV shows.","Netflix estimates that Bird Box, its buzzy film starring Sandra Bullock, was viewed by more than 80 million members in its first four weeks. The company also said that \"You,\" a new thriller TV series, was watched by more than 40 million members in its first four weeks. ","The earnings report did not indicate whether the viewership numbers have been vetted by a third party.","\"These are less financial metrics as they are a cultural metric,\" Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said on the call.  He compared these stats to box office numbers and noted their potential to get people talking about the show or movie is popular at that moment. ","\"What's important is for part of your Netflix subscription, you are in the zeitgeist,\" he said. \"You're watching the programming that the rest of the world is loving at the same time.\"","More than that, though, the numbers may send a clear message to both investors and Hollywood talent: yes, people really are watching.","---"],"61":["San Francisco  (CNN Business) - Amazon investors are urging the company to halt sales of its facial-recognition software to government agencies over fears the technology could be used to violate people's rights.","In a resolution filed Thursday, a group of shareholders asked Amazon's board to stop selling its tool, Rekognition, to governments unless a third-party evaluation determines it \"does not cause or contribute to actual or potential violations of civil and human rights.\"","The group was organized by Open MIC, a nonprofit that encourages activism by investors in tech and media companies. The investors behind the resolution, which include the religious order Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, hope Amazon's board will put it to a vote at the online retailer's annual shareholder meeting in the spring. ","Shareholder resolutions are rarely approved, and they are not binding. That means that even if the facial-recognition one does pass, the company doesn't have to abide by it. The group of shareholders didn't say how much of Amazon's stock (AMZN) it holds.","Rekognition uses deep learning \u2014 an artificial intelligence technique for finding patterns in data \u2014 to identify objects (such as cats or sofas), faces and scenes in videos and images. For example, it could be used to scan the faces of people entering a courthouse in real time to see if they are in a criminal database. Released in 2016, it has been used by government customers including police departments in Florida and Oregon.","The shareholder group is the latest organization to voice concerns about the potential misuse of AI, and of facial recognition, in particular.","While facial-recognition software can be helpful for combating issues such as sex trafficking, it's still quite error prone. The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes Amazon's sale of the software to the government, highlighted one of the issues with facial recognition technology in July. It said that it tested Rekognition and found that it incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress with mugshots in a database, and that the errors were more common with people of color.","Last year, nearly 20 groups of Amazon shareholders sent a letter to CEO Jeff Bezos, asking the company to stop selling Rekognition to the government.

As he did for much of her captivity, he put her under his bed and blocked her in with several weights and totes before he left. ","This time, though, Jayme pushed aside the weights and fled to safety, according to the criminal complaint.

And while that sounds like a long timescale, this is a significant increase compared to the previous 700 million years. ","So why is this a big deal -- apart from asteroids hurtling through space and colliding with our planet? The new findings are changing the way we look back on Earth's history. ","For decades, scientists have been trying to determine the rate that asteroids impact Earth. They studied impact craters on Earth and the age of the rocks around them. But that method came with its own roadblocks. The biggest issue: The earliest impact craters were missing.","Before this study, scientists believed they couldn't find the oldest impact craters on Earth because erosion or other geological processes wiped them from the surface. And compared to other planets in the solar system, Earth has fewer older impact craters than expected. ","So they decided to study the moon instead, a perfect analog for Earth, crater-wise, because both were hit similarly over time. Craters are also more well-preserved on the moon because it doesn't undergo the same disruptive processes that Earth does. ","\"The only obstacle to doing this has been finding an accurate way to date large craters on the Moon,\" William Bottke, study co-author and asteroid expert at the Southwest Research Institute, said in a statement.","NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which began its mission around the moon a decade ago, gathered thermal data and images that the researchers were able to use. Thermal data showed how much heat was radiating off of the lunar surface. Larger rocks give off more heat than regolith, or the fine soil on the surface. ","Rebecca Ghent, study co-author and planetary scientist at the University of Toronto, determined the rate at which rocks break down into soil. She also discovered that older craters are covered by fewer boulders and rocks than younger craters. This is because tiny meteorites hitting the moon help to grind down the boulders over time. ","What they discovered is that the earliest craters on the Earth aren't missing -- they don't exist. And they don't exist on the moon either. ","\"This means that the Earth has fewer older craters on its most stable regions not because of erosion, but because the impact rate was lower prior to 290 million years ago,\" Bottke said. \"The Moon is like a time capsule, helping us understand the Earth. We found that the Moon shared a similar bombardment history, which meant the answer to Earth's impact rate was staring everyone right in the face.\"","The finding was so surprising that they wanted more evidence for confirmation.","The answer lay with kimberlite pipes. These pipes are actually long-extinct volcanoes and they stretch more than a mile below the Earth's surface in a carrot shape. The pipes are largely mined for diamonds and found in the least eroded parts of Earth. This is also where preserved impact craters are found. ","Tom Gernon, study co-author and Earth scientist at the University of Southampton, found that kimberlite pipes formed in the last 650 million years on stable terrain. This means that the impact craters found in the same area are also intact. ","\"Our research provides evidence for a dramatic change in the rate of asteroid impacts on both Earth and the Moon that occurred around the end of the Paleozoic era,\" said Sara Mazrouei in a statement, lead study author and planetary scientist. \"The implication is that since that time we have been in a period of relatively high rate of asteroid impacts that is 2.6 times higher than it was prior to 290 million years ago.\"","Their method of studying kimberlite pipes and impact craters may be applicable outside of Earth studies in the future.","\"We can now apply this technique to study the surfaces of other planets to find out if they might also show more impacts,\" Bottke said. \"Our findings also have implications for the history of life, which is punctuated by extinction events and rapid evolution of new species. Though the forces driving these events are complicated, asteroid impacts have surely played a role in this ongoing saga.\"","The change in the rate of asteroids colliding with the Earth and moon may be due to the large collisions that were happening in the main asteroid belt. The belt lies between Mars and Jupiter, and this area was highly active 300 million years ago. That would have created a stream of debris that would enter the inner solar system. ","And the uptick in asteroid collisions happened alongside the age of the dinosaurs.","\"[Dinosaurs] as a species were particularly vulnerable to large impacts from the get-go, more so than earlier animal groups,\" Gernon said. \"It's perhaps fair to say it was a date with destiny for the dinosaurs -- their downfall was somewhat inevitable given the surge of large space rocks colliding with Earth.\"","---"],"64":["(CNN) - Imagine this: A 46-year-old former congresswoman and mother of three, who just lost a Senate bid to one of the most despised incumbents, sets off on a road trip adventure to clear her head.
